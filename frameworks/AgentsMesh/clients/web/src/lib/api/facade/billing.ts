// Legacy `billingApi` adapter. After the proto migration this thin wrapper
// delegates to billingConnect.ts (binary-wire Connect-RPC) so existing call
// sites keep working unchanged while the wire is now prost-encoded — PR #334
// fix preserved end-to-end.
//
// New call sites should import directly from `./billingConnect`; this module
// stays as the dual-track shim until every consumer flips.
