"""Guard: every test directory must be collected by some CI lane or be on
the explicit allowlist below.

Three separate incidents on 2026-07-05 found test files that no CI lane
ever collects (fastvideo/tests/stages/, tests/local_tests/ additions in
PR #1509, and this sweep found seven dark directories in total): the tests
pass review, merge, and then silently never run. This test makes going
dark an explicit, reviewed decision instead of an accident: adding a new
test directory fails CI until it is either wired into a lane or
allowlisted here with a reason.

Pure text analysis — no fastvideo imports, no GPU, no torch.
