## Quickstart

One command stands up the full stack — API gateway, scheduler, safety
kernel, workflow engine, context engine, dashboard, NATS, and
TLS-secured Redis — with auto-generated secrets, auto-provisioned
certificates, and a post-deploy smoke test that exercises a real
approval workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cordum-io/cordum.git
cd cordum
./tools/scripts/quickstart.sh
```

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop v4+ (or Engine v20.10+ with Compose v2,
≥ 4 GB RAM allocated), Go 1.26.3+ (for first-run cert generation), and
`curl`. On Windows use MSYS2 / Git Bash / WSL.

**What you get at the end:**
- Dashboard at http://localhost:8082 — log in as `admin` / `ChangeMe123!`
  (the default dev password, also saved to `.env` as `CORDUM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`;
  change it before exposing the stack).
- Gateway at http://localhost:8081 with a generated `CORDUM_API_KEY` in
  `.env`.
- TLS CA, server, and client keypairs under `./certs/`.
- A working approval-gate workflow proven by the built-in
  `platform_smoke.sh` run.

Full walkthrough, platform notes, and troubleshooting:
[docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

### See a 3-verdict demo

Once the stack is up, install the `demo-quickstart` pack and run the
governance demo:

```bash
cordumctl pack install ./demo/quickstart/pack
cordumctl demo run quickstart
```

A single `hello, operator!` workflow fans out to three topics and
exercises every safety-kernel decision class in under 30 seconds:

```
  +--------------------+--------------------------+--------------------+---------
  | Step               | Topic                    | Verdict            | Reason
  +--------------------+--------------------------+--------------------+---------
  | greet              | job.demo-quickstart.greet           | ALLOW              | Safe…
  | attempt_delete     | job.demo-quickstart.delete-all      | DENY               | Block…
  | escalate_admin     | job.demo-quickstart.admin           | REQUIRE_APPROVAL   | Sign…
  +--------------------+--------------------------+--------------------+---------
```

Full walkthrough, rule-by-rule explanation, and extension recipe:
[demo/quickstart/README.md](demo/quickstart/README.md).

### Edge Quickstart (Compliance Firewall for Claude Code)

Cordum Edge governs Claude Code tool calls in the developer's terminal — the
hook denies risky actions before they run, requires approval on edits, and
exports a redacted evidence bundle for every session. Once the platform stack
is up (above), point Claude Code at Cordum:

```bash
export CORDUM_GATEWAY=https://localhost:8081
export CORDUM_API_KEY=$(grep CORDUM_API_KEY .env | cut -d= -f2)
export CORDUM_TENANT_ID=default
./bin/cordumctl edge claude
```

The wrapper renders a temporary `settings.json`, spawns `cordum-agentd` on a
local loopback nonce, and starts Claude Code with the command hook installed.
Read .env is denied; Edit/Write requires approval; safe reads pass through
untouched. The dashboard shows the live session timeline at
[/edge/sessions](http://localhost:8082/edge/sessions).

For approved destructive actions, Edge does not trust the approval store alone:
the ProvenanceGate also requires a resolved approval audit event for the same
tenant, `approval_ref`, and `action_hash`. An approval-requested event by itself
does not satisfy provenance, and raw prompts, transcripts, and tool payloads are
kept out of audit evidence.

## The Problem: The Agent Risk Gap

Enterprises are rushing to deploy **Autonomous AI Agents**, but they're hitting a wall of risk. According to Gartner, **74% of enterprises see AI agents as a new attack vector**, and over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled due to inadequate risk controls.

The current landscape leaves teams with a choice:
1. **Restrict agents** to simple, low-value read-only tasks.
2. **Accept the risk** of autonomous agents taking destructive, unmonitored actions.

Without a dedicated governance layer, you're flying blind:
- **No visibility**: You don't know what your agents are doing until *after* they do it.
- **No safety rails**: There's no way to intercept dangerous operations before they execute.
- **No human-in-the-loop**: Sensitive actions happen without manual oversight.
- **No audit trail**: When things go wrong, you can't reconstruct the chain of thought.

## The Solution: Cordum Agent Control Plane

Cordum is an **Agent Control Plane** that provides a deterministic governance layer for probabilistic AI minds. It allows you to define, enforce, and audit the behavior of your **Autonomous AI Agents** across any framework or model.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph CP [AGENT CONTROL PLANE]
        direction LR
        G[API Gateway] --- S[Scheduler] --- SK[Safety Kernel]
        S --- WE[Workflow Engine]
    end
    
    subgraph AGENTS [AUTONOMOUS AGENT POOLS]
        direction LR
        A1[Financial Ops]

```

### Governance Across the Lifecycle

Cordum's **Before/During/Across** framework provides exhaustive control over your agent operations:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph BEFORE [1. BEFORE - Governance]
        P[Policy Evaluation] --> S[Safety Gating]
        S --> H[Human Approval]
    end
    subgraph DURING [2. DURING - Safety]
        M[Real-time Monitoring] --> C[Circuit Breakers]
        C --> A[Live Approvals]
    end
    subgraph ACROSS [3. ACROSS - Observability]
        F[Fleet Health] --> T[Audit Trail]
        T --> O[Optimization]
    end
    BEFORE --> DURING
    DURING --> ACROSS
```

- **BEFORE (Governance)**: Define declarative policies that evaluate job requests *before* an agent executes. Trigger safety kernel checks, throttle risky actions, or flag operations for human approval.
- **DURING (Safety)**: Real-time visibility into active agent runs. Monitor progress, handle step-level approvals, and enforce timeouts or circuit breakers on the fly.
- **ACROSS (Observability)**: Manage your entire fleet from a single control plane. Aggregate audit trails, track capability-based routing, and observe agent pool health in real-time.


### Cordum Edge: Compliance Firewall for AI agents

Cordum Edge extends the control plane to local AI-agent actions. For Claude Code,
`cordumctl edge claude` launches the real P0 path — command hook, local
`cordum-agentd`, Gateway Edge APIs, Safety Kernel policy/evaluate, approvals,
artifact pointers, and dashboard evidence.

Cordum stays quiet until governance matters. Developers see Cordum exactly when
it protects them, their team, and production: before risky tools run, when an
action needs approval, and when evidence must be exported. The wrapper is the
developer/demo path; enterprise enforcement requires managed Claude settings and
endpoint controls.

Approval provenance is resolved-only: destructive retries must have a matching
approved approval record and a canonical resolved approval audit event for the
same tenant/ref/hash. Requested-only audit rows are lifecycle context, not proof
that the action was approved.

Start here: [Edge overview](docs/edge.md), [Claude Code guide](docs/edge-claude-code.md),
[manual demo](docs/demo-edge-claude.md), and [Edge API](docs/edge/api.md).

## Quickstart

### First Time?

| Goal | Path |
|------|------|
| **Just want to try it?** | `./tools/scripts/quickstart.sh` — one-command install from source ([guide](docs/quickstart.md)) |
| **Run the full stack from pre-built images?** | `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` (below) — once release images ship to ghcr.io |
| **Developing Cordum?** | See [Development](#development) |

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop v4+** or **Docker Engine v20.10+** with the **Compose v2** plugin (≥ 4 GB RAM allocated to Docker).
- **jq** (recommended, for parsing API responses).

### Run the published images

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cordum-io/cordum.git
cd cordum
export CORDUM_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
docker compose pull         # pulls every Cordum service from ghcr.io
docker compose up -d        # starts the stack — no source build needed
```

**Dashboard:** http://localhost:8082
**Login:** this path leaves user auth off by default — sign in on the dashboard
with your `CORDUM_API_KEY`. To enable `admin` password login instead, set
`CORDUM_USER_AUTH_ENABLED=true` and a policy-compliant `CORDUM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
(≥ 12 chars, with an uppercase letter, a digit, and a special character) in
`.env`, then `docker compose up -d`. (The quickstart script does this for you.)

Pin a specific release by exporting `CORDUM_VERSION=1.2.3` before
`docker compose pull`. Defaults to `:latest`, which only moves on stable
release tags (pre-release suffixes such as `-rc.1` never promote
`:latest`).

### Verifying image signatures

Every release-tag image is signed with [cosign] keyless OIDC. Verify
before deploying to production:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/cordum-io/cordum/api-gateway:1.2.3 \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\.com/cordum-io/cordum/\.github/workflows/docker\.yml@refs/tags/v.*'
```

See [docs/deployment/images.md](docs/deployment/images.md) for the full
image catalogue, multi-arch pull instructions, and tag policy.

[cosign]: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (without docker compose)</summary>

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set CORDUM_API_KEY (or generate: openssl rand -hex 32)
export CORDUM_API_KEY="your-key-here"
go run ./cmd/cordumctl up
open http://localhost:8082
```
</details>

### Deploy to Kubernetes

```bash
helm install cordum oci://ghcr.io/cordum-io/cordum/charts/cordum \
  --namespace cordum --create-namespace \
  --set secrets.apiKey=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  --set redis.auth.password=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.className=nginx \
  --set ingress.api.host=api.cordum.example.com \
  --set ingress.dashboard.host=cordum.example.com
```

### Ports

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 8082 | Dashboard |
| 8081 | API Gateway (HTTPS) |
| 9080 | gRPC Gateway |
| 4222 | NATS |
| 6379 | Redis |
| 9092 | Gateway Metrics |
| 9093 | Workflow Engine Health |
| 50051 | Safety Kernel (gRPC) |
| 50400 | Context Engine (gRPC) |

> **Port conflicts?** If any port is already in use, either stop the conflicting service or override ports in your `.env` file before starting the stack.

### After Setup

```bash
# Submit a test job
curl -sS --cacert ./certs/ca/ca.crt \
  -X POST https://localhost:8081/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CORDUM_API_KEY" -H "X-Tenant-ID: default" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic":"job.default","prompt":"hello"}'

# Stop the stack
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f api-gateway
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Port already in use | `docker compose down` then retry, or check `lsof -i :8082` |
| Docker out of memory | Allocate at least 4 GB RAM to Docker Desktop |
| Can't login to dashboard | Default is `admin` / `ChangeMe123!` (in `.env` as `CORDUM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`); ensure `CORDUM_USER_AUTH_ENABLED=true`. Custom passwords must be ≥12 chars + uppercase + digit + special |
| TLS/SSL cert errors | Remove `./certs/` and re-run — certs auto-regenerate |
| `openssl` not found | Not needed — quickstart.sh auto-generates keys without it |
| Go build fails | Requires Go 1.26.3+ — check with `go version` |
| Stale config after changes | `redis-cli DEL cfg:system:default` then restart |

For detailed troubleshooting, see [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Development

The published-images path above pulls Cordum binaries from `ghcr.io`.
Contributors who need to rebuild from source use the development override
file:

```bash
make dev-up      # docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
make dev-logs    # tail compose logs
make dev-down    # docker compose down
```

`docker-compose.dev.yml` re-pins every Cordum service to a local
`cordum/<name>:dev` tag and forces the `build:` context, so source
changes are reflected on the next `--build`. Upstream images (NATS,
Redis) are untouched. See `Makefile` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` for
full details.

Other useful contributor commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Build every service binary into `bin/` (wraps `make proto` first). |
| `make build SERVICE=cordumctl` | Build a single service. |
| `make test` | Run the full Go test suite. |
| `make smoke` | Quick post-deploy smoke against a running stack. |

## Protocol: CAP — The Open Standard for Agent Governance

Cordum implements [CAP (Cordum Agent Protocol)](https://github.com/cordum-io/cap), an open protocol specifically designed for distributed AI agent governance. CAP provides a unified interface for defining agent capabilities, submitting jobs, and enforcing safety policies across heterogeneous agent pools.

### CAP vs. MCP: Why You Need Both

While both are essential, they solve different parts of the agent stack:

| Protocol | Focus | Level | Responsibility |
|----------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) | **Tool Calling** | Local | How a model interacts with a tool. |
| **CAP** (Cordum Agent Protocol) | **Governance** | Network | How an agent is governed within an enterprise. |

- **MCP** is for *within* the agent — it defines how a model calls local tools.
- **CAP** is for *above* the agent — it defines the governance control plane for the entire agent fleet.

Use CAP for high-level orchestration and safety gating, and MCP inside your agents for fine-grained tool integration.

[Read the full deep dive: MCP vs CAP: Why Your AI Agents Need Both Protocols](https://dev.to/yaron_torgeman_104570d968/-mcp-vs-cap-why-your-ai-agents-need-both-protocols-3g4l)

## MCP Server

Cordum includes an MCP server framework with:

- **Standalone stdio mode** via `cmd/cordum-mcp` (for Claude Desktop/Code local integration)
- **Gateway HTTP/SSE mode** via `/mcp/message` and `/mcp/sse` (when `mcp.enabled=true`)

See [docs/mcp-server.md](docs/mcp-server.md) for setup, auth headers, and client configuration examples.

## SDK

The Go SDK makes it easy to build CAP-compatible workers:

```go
import (
    "log"

    "github.com/cordum/cordum/sdk/runtime"
)

type Input struct {
    Prompt string `json:"prompt"`
}

type Output struct {
    Summary string `json:"summary"`
}

func main() {
    // AllowUnsigned is required when the worker holds no signing keys;
    // CAP fails closed at startup otherwise. Provision worker trust keys
    // for anything beyond local development -- see docs/sdk/handshake.md.
    agent := &runtime.Agent{Retries: 2, AllowUnsigned: true}

    runtime.Register(agent, "job.summarize", func(ctx runtime.Context, input Input) (Output, error) {
        // Your agent logic here
        return Output{Summary: input.Prompt}, nil
    })

    if err := agent.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    select {}
}
```

SDKs: **Go** (stable) | [**Python**](https://github.com/cordum-io/cap) | [**Node**](https://github.com/cordum-io/cap)

Stable CAP Go, Python, and Node runtimes implement the same authenticated
protobuf worker-trust contract. A legacy capability handshake or heartbeat is
telemetry, not identity proof, unless it is bound into an accepted session.
Deployments remain at the explicit compatibility default
`CORDUM_SDK_HANDSHAKE=off` + `CORDUM_HEARTBEAT_MODE=authority` until worker
proof keys and control-plane signing authorities are provisioned. Follow the
[authenticated worker trust guide](docs/sdk/handshake.md) before enabling
`warn` or `enforce`.

## Integration Packs

Extend Cordum with [30+ integration packs](https://github.com/cordum-io/cordum-packs) for Slack, GitHub, AWS, Jira, Terraform, Datadog, PagerDuty, and more. Each pack is a CAP-native worker with policy-gated workflows.
