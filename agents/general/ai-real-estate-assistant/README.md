## 🌐 Live Demo

<div align="center">

### [**🚀 Try the Live Demo →**](https://realestate-web-dz1y.onrender.com/)

**No login required — explore in demo mode**

</div>

Experience the full power of AI-driven real estate search without any setup:

- 🔍 **Natural Language Property Search** — ask questions like *"2-bedroom apartment in Kraków under 500k"* and get matched listings
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Chat** — conversational interface for finding your perfect property
- 📊 **Financial Tools** — mortgage calculator, rent-vs-buy comparison, ROI analysis, and TCO calculator
- 🗺️ **Interactive Maps** — clustered property markers with area analytics
- 🌍 **9 Languages** — English, Polish, Russian, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Ukrainian

> **Note:** The demo uses simulated AI responses for instant exploration. Production deployment requires API keys.

## 🆕 What's New in v5.1

Three small but demoable additions, shipped together as a focused release:

- **AI Property Valuation with Multi-Year Price Forecast** — paste a property id (or enter features manually) and get an LLM-powered estimate of current value plus projected value at 1y, 3y, 5y, and 10y horizons, with a confidence band and key drivers. Try it at `/valuation`.
- **Inline monthly payment on listing cards** — every property card on the search results page now shows a small "$X / mo" estimate next to the title (20% down, 30-year fixed, 6.5% APR by default; not a lending offer).
- **AI Neighborhood One-Liner** — property detail pages now feature a short AI-generated summary of the neighborhood's character, lifestyle, and accessibility. Falls back silently if the LLM is unavailable.

All three work in demo mode without any paid external APIs.

## 💻 Local Demo Setup

Run the full demo locally with comprehensive mock data in minutes:

## 🖥️ Deployment & Memory Notes

The backend uses an **environment-conditional lazy provider load** (`apps/api/models/provider_factory.py`) to stay under Render's free-tier 512 MB memory cap. This is **only triggered when the `RENDER` env var is set to `"true"`** (which Render does automatically on every service).

| Platform / Setup | `RENDER` set? | Provider loading | Memory baseline | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Render** (free / starter) | ✅ yes | Lazy — only the active `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` (`zai`) is imported at startup; the other 12 are loaded on first use | ~480 MB | Workaround for 512 MB hard cap |
| **VPS / bare metal** | ❌ no | Eager — all 13 providers imported at startup | ~530 MB | No memory constraint; full DX |
| **Docker / docker-compose** (local or self-hosted) | ❌ no (unless you set it) | Eager — all 13 providers imported at startup | ~530 MB | Same as VPS |
| **Other PaaS** (Fly.io, Railway, Render preview, AWS App Runner, etc.) | ❌ no | Eager — all 13 providers imported at startup | depends on instance type | Pick a plan with ≥1 GB RAM for safety |
| **Local dev / CI** | ❌ no | Eager | ~530 MB | Tests assume this path |

If you self-host on a VPS, Docker, or any non-Render platform, **you don't need to do anything** — the eager path gives you all 13 providers from the start with no artificial latency. The lazy path is a Render-specific workaround for the 512 MB free-tier cap and is **not** a best practice for memory-constrained production deployments in general.

To override the gate (e.g. force lazy loading on a different platform), set `RENDER=true` in the environment.

<!-- Chart is regenerated daily by .github/workflows/star-history.yml (custom Python
     step: GitHub REST + matplotlib at 1400x533). Static SVG on the star-history orphan
     branch. The hosted star-history.com embed broke when GitHub restricted the
     stargazers API on 2026-06-30; the previous carsteneu/mystarhistory@v1 self-hosted
     step hardcoded 800x533 and emitted one label per month, causing the X-axis labels
     to overlap. -->

## 🏠 Three Developer Differentiators

### 1. Multi-Provider LLM Routing
13 LLM providers with automatic fallback chain — OpenAI, Anthropic Google, Grok, DeepSeek, and local Ollama. Per-request provider selection via header or request parameter; no code changes required to switch models.

### 2. Hybrid RAG + ChromaDB Vector Search
Query complexity classifier routes requests to RAG-only (simple), hybrid RAG+enhancement (medium), or agent+tools (complex). ChromaDB with MMR reranking provides semantic similarity search.

### 3. 9-Language Localization
English, Polish, Russian, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Ukrainian — with EU AI Act compliance labels on AI-generated outputs.

<!-- HOSTED-FUNNEL-START -->
## Hosted Version: PropVector AI

PropVector AI is the hosted version of this project — the same core RAG
and vector-search engine, with managed tiers for live data, accounts,
AI CRM, and enterprise capabilities. The repo stays open-core: the core
engine remains free, anything that gates revenue lives in the hosted product.

| Capability | OSS (this repo) | Hosted (PropVector AI) |
|---|---|---|
| Core RAG property Q&A, demo dataset | Free | Included |
| Bring-your-own LLM keys, local Ollama | Free | Included |
| Vector search (ChromaDB) on sample data | Free | Included |
| Live/MLS data feeds, enrichment pipeline | Not included | Pro |
| Accounts, favorites, saved searches, alerts | Not included | Pro |
| AI CRM (lead scoring, drip, pipeline) | Not included | Pro/Enterprise |
| Multi-agent Agentic OS | Limited | Pro |
| CRM connectors (HubSpot/Pipedrive), SSO, MFA | Not included | Enterprise |
| White-label / self-host support contract | Not included | Enterprise (custom) |

**Free $0** · **Pro $29/mo** · **Enterprise (custom)** — tiers reflect
the public roadmap and may adjust before launch.

[PropVector AI](https://propvectorai.com) is launching soon; the landing
page ships alongside billing. The fastest way to reach the maintainer
today is to [open a Discussion](https://github.com/AleksNeStu/ai-real-estate-assistant/discussions)
