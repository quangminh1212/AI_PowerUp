>*The modern internet built on public clouds is increasingly threatening your personal data privacy. As reliance on services like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Facebook grows, so does the risk to your digital autonomy. Your data lives on their servers, subject to their terms, tracking, and potential censorship.*
>
>*It's time for a change.* 

![Personal Cloud](https://app.cdn.olares.com/github/olares/public-cloud-to-personal-cloud.jpg)
We believe you have a fundamental right to control your digital life. The most effective way to uphold this right is by hosting your data locally, on your own hardware.

Olares is an **open-source personal cloud operating system** designed to empower you to own and manage your digital assets locally. Instead of relying on public cloud services, you can deploy powerful open-source alternatives locally on Olares, such as Ollama for hosting LLMs, ComfyUI for image generation, and Vane (formerly Perplexica) for private, AI-driven search and reasoning. Imagine the power of the cloud, but with you in complete command.

## Architecture 

Just as Public clouds offer IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS layers, Olares provides open-source alternatives to each of these layers.
