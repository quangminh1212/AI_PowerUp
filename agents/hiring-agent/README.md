## Context and intent

This project got a lot of attention recently, and some of the discussion surfaced misconceptions worth addressing directly.

**What this is not:**
- Not an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)
- Not used to screen HackerRank's open roles
- Not a product available to HackerRank customers

**What it actually is:**

Every year HackerRank receives 50,000–60,000 intern applications. No human can read that many resumes well. This tool was built to *rank* them — helping decide which resumes to read first. Resumes scoring below the cutoff are filtered out, but the cutoff is intentionally set very low so only candidates at the very bottom of the distribution are removed. The vast majority pass through to human review, where the real decisions are made.

Since this was built, HackerRank has also shipped [AI Interviewer (Chakra)](https://www.hackerrank.com/products/ai-interviewer/) to automate the first round of interviews — so candidates are no longer assessed on their resume alone.

**On the default model:**

The repo ships with `gemma3:4b` as the default because it runs locally on most laptops without any cloud API key. Actual intern resumes at HackerRank are evaluated using a top-tier Gemini model. The repo ships with a demo config, not the production one.

## Coverage

Articles and discussions that have shaped how we think about improving this project:

| Article | Key takeaway |
|---|---|
| [HackerRank open sourced its ATS. My resume scored 90/100. Oh wait 74/100. No — 88/100. Actually 83/100.](https://danunparsed.com/p/hackerrank-open-source-ats) — *Dan Kinsky* | Deep statistical analysis of score variance across 100 runs of the same resume. Isolates which categories are stable (technical skills) vs. noisy (project quality judgments). Points to LLM non-determinism as the root cause. |
| [The Score Depends on the Roll of the Dice](https://pinggy.io/blog/hackerrank_open_source_ats_inconsistent_scoring/) — *Pinggy Blog* | Reproduces the variance findings and surfaces a security issue: invisible text embedded in PDFs can inflate scores significantly. |
| [The Hiring Rubric Inside](https://byteiota.com/hackerrank-ats-open-source-the-hiring-rubric-inside/) — *ByteIota* | Breaks down the scoring weights and argues that a GitHub-centric rubric disadvantages engineers whose work is in private enterprise repos. Also notes the signal degradation risk as candidates optimize for the now-public rubric. |
| [Analyzing resume scoring consistency](https://dev.to/mgobea/hackerrank-open-sourced-its-ats-analyzing-resume-scoring-consistency-1j5d) — *Mariano Gobea Alcoba, DEV Community* | Proposes concrete fixes: standardized data formats, versioned evaluation models, ensemble scoring, and explainability layers to reduce variance and make the system more robust. |
| [AI-Powered Pipeline for Explainable Resume Scoring](https://aitoolly.com/ai-news/article/2026-06-26-interviewstreet-unveils-hiring-agent-an-ai-powered-pipeline-for-explainable-resume-scoring-and-githu) — *AIToolly* | Covers the launch and highlights the transparency argument — making scoring logic public allows scrutiny that proprietary ATS systems never face. |
| [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=48713832) | 200+ comment thread covering LLM determinism, GDPR Article 22 implications, and the broader ethics of automated resume filtering. |

## Overview

Hiring Agent parses a resume PDF to Markdown, extracts sectioned JSON using a local or hosted LLM, augments the data with GitHub profile and repository signals, then produces an objective evaluation with category scores, evidence, bonus points, and deductions. You can run fully local with Ollama or use Google Gemini.

---

## Architecture

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**Flow**

1. `pymupdf_rag.py` converts PDF pages to Markdown-like text.
2. `pdf.py` calls the LLM per section using Jinja templates under `prompts/templates`.
3. `github.py` fetches profile and repos, classifies projects, and asks the LLM to select the top 7.
4. `evaluator.py` runs a strict-scored evaluation with fairness constraints.
5. `score.py` orchestrates everything end to end and writes CSV when development mode is on.

</td>
<td>

**Key modules**

- `models.py`
  Pydantic schemas and LLM provider interfaces.

- `llm_utils.py`
  Provider initialization and response cleanup.

- `transform.py`
  Normalization from loose LLM JSON to JSON Resume style.

- `prompts/`
  All Jinja templates for extraction and scoring.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**

  The repository pins `.python-version` to 3.11.13.

- **One LLM backend** (either of them)

  - **Ollama** for local models
    Install from the [official site](https://ollama.com/), then run `ollama serve`.
  - **Google Gemini** if you have an API key, get it from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).

### Quick setup with pip

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/interviewstreet/hiring-agent
$ cd hiring-agent

$ python -m venv .venv
# Linux or macOS
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Ollama Models

Pull the model you want to use. For example:

```bash
$ ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

If you want different results, you can pull other models such as:

```bash
# For higher system configuration
$ ollama pull gemma3:12b

# For lower system configuration
$ ollama pull gemma3:1b
```

---

## Configuration

Copy the template and set your environment variables.

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

**Environment variables**

| Variable         | Values                                      | Description                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LLM_PROVIDER`   | `ollama` or `gemini`                        | Chooses provider. Defaults to Ollama.                                  |
| `DEFAULT_MODEL`  | for example `gemma3:4b` or `gemini-2.5-pro` | Model name passed to the provider.                                     |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | string                                      | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini`.                                   |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`   | optional                                    | Inherits from your shell environment, improves GitHub API rate limits. |

Provider mapping lives in `prompt.py` and `models.py`. The `config.py` file has a single flag:

```python
# config.py
DEVELOPMENT_MODE = True  # enables caching and CSV export
```

You can leave it on during iteration. See the next section for details.

## How it works

<details>
<summary><b>1) PDF extraction</b></summary>

- `pymupdf_rag.py` and `pdf.py` read the PDF using PyMuPDF and convert pages to Markdown-like text.
- The `to_markdown` routine handles headings, links, tables, and basic formatting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2) Section parsing with templates</b></summary>

- `prompts/templates/*.jinja` define strict instructions for each section
  Basics, Work, Education, Skills, Projects, Awards.
- `pdf.PDFHandler` calls the LLM per section and assembles a `JSONResume` object (see `models.py`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3) GitHub enrichment</b></summary>

- `github.py` extracts a username from the resume profiles, fetches profile and repos, and classifies each project.
- It asks the LLM to select exactly 7 unique projects with a minimum author commit threshold, favoring meaningful contributions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4) Evaluation</b></summary>

- `evaluator.py` uses templates that encode fairness and scoring rules.
- Scores include `open_source`, `self_projects`, `production`, and `technical_skills`, plus bonus and deductions, then an explanation for evidence.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5) Output and CSV export</b></summary>

- `score.py` prints a readable summary to stdout.
- When `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=True` it creates or appends a `resume_evaluations.csv` with key fields, and caches intermediate JSON under `cache/`.

</details>

---

## CLI usage

### End to end scoring

Provide a path to a resume PDF.

```bash
$ python score.py ./resume/sample.pdf
```

What happens:

1. If development mode is on, the PDF extraction result is cached to `cache/resumecache_<basename>.json`.
2. If a GitHub profile is found in the resume, repositories are fetched and cached to `cache/githubcache_<basename>.json`.
3. The evaluator prints a report and, in development mode, appends a CSV row to `resume_evaluations.csv`.
