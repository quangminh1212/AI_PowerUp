## Generate
Click the "Generate" button to open a task pane with a text box and a "Generate" button. Simply type your prompt in the text box (plaintext only) and press CTRL+Enter or click the button to generate a response. The AI will use any available RAG context and the contents of your Word document to craft its reply. Once the response is ready, it will be seamlessly converted from markdown into Word formatting.

## Writing Tools
Expand the "Writing Tools" menu to choose from three options: Review, Proofread, and Rewrite.
- Review: Select text in your document and click "Review" for AI feedback. It will provide suggestions to improve your writing, acting like a supportive mentor.
- Proofread and Rewrite: Simply select text and let the AI refine or rework it for you.

## RAG Control
Use the RAG Control to enhance the AI’s understanding by adding PDFs with relevant context. This additional context is applied when using the Generate, Review, and Comment features.

## Comments
Ask questions directly within your document by tagging the AI in a Word comment using "@". It’s intuitive and integrates seamlessly with [Word’s modern comments feature](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-modern-comments-in-word-edc6ae71-0a2d-49fe-8faa-986f1e48136a), making collaboration and guidance easier than ever. For example, if you’ve selected the Qwen2.5:1.5b model in the dropdown, simply type "@qwen2.5:1.5b" in a comment, and the AI will reply right there, streamlining your workflow.

# Development
To customize and develop this Software, follow these steps:
1. Download and run the [Visual Studio® 2022 installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
2. When the installer opens, select both ".NET desktop development" and "Office/SharePoint development." When ".NET desktop development" is selected, under "Installation details" on the right, scroll to the "Optional" section and ensure the ".NET Framework 4.8.1 development tools" checkbox is selected.
3. Click "Install."
4. Clone this repository using Git.
5. Open the solution by double-clicking on the "TextForge.sln" file.
6. First, build the "TextCraft" project (in Release mode), then right-click on the "OfficeAddInSetup" project and select "Build."
7. Navigate to the project directory and find the "OfficeAddInSetup" folder, which contains the add-in setup files.
8. Be sure to clean the "TextCraft" project in both "Debug" and "Release" modes by right-clicking on the project in Visual Studio and selecting "Clean." This is necessary because building the project in Visual Studio, even without running the add-in installer, will automatically install the add-in in Microsoft Word. Cleaning is the only way to remove it.
