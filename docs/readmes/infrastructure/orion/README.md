## Quick Start

```bash
# Build (no Xcode required)
make

# Run inference
./orion infer --prompt "The meaning of life is" --max_tokens 128 --ane

# Train a model
./orion train --weights model/blobs/stories110m --dataset data/tinystories.bin --steps 1000
```

Everything runs offline. No data leaves your device.

## Why ANE?

Apple ships a dedicated Neural Engine (NPU) in every iPhone, iPad, and Mac sold since 2020 — over **2 billion devices**. Each has a dedicated ML accelerator capable of **~19 TFLOPS fp16** (Apple claims 38 TOPS INT8, but [maderix showed](https://maderix.substack.com/p/inside-the-m4-apple-neural-engine-615) the ANE dequantizes to fp16 before computation). Yet Apple only exposes it through CoreML, which:

- adds significant compilation and dispatch overhead
- restricts operations to Apple-approved model formats
- does not support training at all

Orion bypasses CoreML entirely. It talks to the ANE through private frameworks (`_ANEClient`, `_ANECompiler`, MIL IR), giving full control over compilation, memory layout, and scheduling. This opens up capabilities Apple never intended:

- **Training on the ANE** — forward and backward passes on hardware Apple restricted to inference
- **Delta compilation** — reload weights without recompiling, reducing training overhead by 8.5x
- **LoRA hot-swap** — adapter matrices as IOSurface inputs, zero recompilation on swap
- **Custom kernel pipelines** — compiler-generated MIL from graph IR with optimization passes

Orion builds on foundational work by [maderix](https://github.com/maderix/ANE) (private API reverse-engineering, hardware characterization) and [ANEgpt](https://github.com/vipuldivyanshu92/ANEgpt) (training kernel structure), extending them into a **production-quality LLM training and inference runtime** with a compiler, stable training (NaN fix), program caching, checkpointing, and benchmark harness.

## How Orion Compares

| Framework | Focus | Training | ANE Direct | Models |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) | GPU inference + training | Yes (GPU) | No | Many |
| [MLC-LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) | Portable inference | No | No | Many |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | Easy model serving | No | No | Many |
| [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) | Portable CPU/GPU inference | No | No | Many |
| **Orion** | **ANE training + inference** | **Yes (ANE)** | **Yes** | GPT-2 124M, Stories110M |

**Orion's niche**: the only framework that targets Apple's Neural Engine directly for both training and inference. Others use GPU (Metal) or CPU. Orion uses the NPU — dedicated silicon that's idle in most workloads.

## What You Can Do

### Inference (3 modes)

```bash
./orion infer --prompt "Hello, world" --ane            # Full ANE forward pass
./orion infer --prompt "Hello, world" --ane-prefill     # ANE prefill → CPU decode
./orion infer --prompt "Hello, world"                   # CPU-only baseline
```

### Training

```bash
# Train with delta compilation (no exec() restart needed)
./orion train --weights model/blobs/stories110m \
  --dataset data/tinystories.bin \
  --steps 1000 --grad_accum 4 --lr 3e-4

# Resume from checkpoint
./orion train --weights model/blobs/stories110m \
  --dataset data/tinystories.bin \
  --steps 100 --grad_accum 4 --lr 1e-5 \
  --resume checkpoints/ckpt_00500.bin
```

Training runs: ANE forward/backward → CPU weight updates → Adam optimizer → delta weight reload (no recompilation). ANE programs are compiled once at startup (72 programs, ~4.5s); subsequent steps reload updated weights in ~494ms instead of recompiling (~4,200ms). Verified stable over **1,000 steps** in 22 minutes (loss: 12.3→8.9, 0 NaN, no memory leak).

### Benchmarking

```bash
./orion bench kernels                        # Per-kernel ANE latency (5 kernel types)
./orion bench inference --prompt "Hello"     # End-to-end tok/s, TFLOPS, ANE utilization
./orion bench training --steps 10            # Training step breakdown (fwd/bwd/dW/Adam)
./orion bench kernels --save-baseline        # Save baseline for regression tracking
./orion bench kernels                        # Compare against saved baseline (>15% = WARN)
```

The benchmark suite measures:
- **TFLOPS** — actual compute throughput on ANE
- **Tokens/sec** — end-to-end inference speed
- **ANE utilization** — time in `orion_eval` vs total wall time
- **Dispatch overhead** — compile + eval scheduling cost
- **Memory** — RSS growth across compiles and swaps

This turns Orion into a **measurement tool** for ANE performance, not just an inference engine.

### Abstraction layers

| Layer | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| `OrionKernel` | Wraps MIL generation + weight dict + cache + compile + eval into one call | Done |
| `OrionModelConfig` | Model architecture description (layers, heads, dims, vocab) | Done |
| `OrionRuntime` | ANE init + delta reload + kernel dispatch | Done |
| `OrionCompiler` | Graph IR → optimized MIL text (validate, optimize, codegen) | Done |

These abstractions make Orion a **general ANE model runtime** rather than a single-model demo. Adding a new model means implementing its compiler frontend (graph builder) and weight layout — the compile-cache-eval machinery is shared.

### Data flow

**Inference**: Tokenize → embed (CPU) → 12 transformer layers on ANE (bucketed prefill or per-token decode) → final layernorm (ANE) → logits projection (CPU, wte is 73MB — too large for ANE SRAM) → sample → repeat.

**Training** (single process, no restarts): 72 ANE programs compiled once at startup (~4.5s). Each step: embed (CPU) → forward layers (ANE, 6 outputs per layer for backward reuse) → loss (CPU) → backward layers (ANE, dx path) → dW accumulation (CPU, GCD async) → Adam (CPU) → delta weight reload (unload → update BLOBFILE on disk → reload, ~494ms for 60 kernels). Zero compiles during training — the ~119 compile-per-process limit never applies.

**Tensor layout**: All ANE I/O uses `fp16 [1, C, 1, S]` on IOSurface-backed memory. CPU↔ANE data transfer transposes between `[seq, d_model]` and `[d_model, seq]`.

## Use Cases

- **Local AI assistants** — private, offline language models on Mac, iPad, or iPhone
- **Educational robotics** — a toy robot running a local LLM on an iPad, no cloud dependency
- **Offline copilots** — code completion, writing assistance, and reasoning without internet
- **Privacy-first applications** — medical, legal, or personal AI where data must never leave the device
- **Edge deployment** — any Apple device with an ANE becomes an inference/training endpoint
- **ML research** — benchmark and profile the Neural Engine with direct kernel-level control

## Project Roadmap

### Stage 1 — Orion Core *(complete)*

ANE training runtime + inference engine. Direct MIL compilation, program caching, weight swapping, benchmark harness. Two models: GPT-2 124M (inference) and Stories110M (training). Runtime abstractions (`OrionKernel`, `OrionRuntime`, model registry) make Orion a general toolkit rather than a single-model demo.

**Status**: Complete. 116/116 tasks.

### Stage 2 — Orion Compiler *(complete)*

Graph-level IR and optimization pipeline that replaces hand-written MIL generators. Models are now defined as compiler frontends (pure C graph builders) instead of hand-written MIL text. The compiler validates, optimizes, and codegens to ANE-compatible MIL automatically.

Capabilities:
- **Graph IR** — ~27 ops, fluent builder API, topological ordering
- **Optimization passes** — DCE, identity elimination, cast fusion, SRAM annotation, uniform output padding
- **ANE validation** — constraint checking before compilation (shape limits, op support)
- **13 compiler frontends** — 4 GPT-2 inference + 6 Stories training + 3 utility kernels
- **MIL diff tool** — structural comparison between generated MIL programs

**Status**: Complete. 32/32 compiler tasks + milgen fully replaced. 21/21 tests pass.

### Stage 2.5 — Orion v2.0 *(complete)*

Three workstreams driven by community feedback (r/MachineLearning) and deferred v1 goals:

- **Delta Compilation** *(complete)* — Bypass ANE recompilation entirely for weight updates. Instead of recompiling 60 programs per step (4,200ms), Orion unloads each program, updates weight files on disk, and reloads (494ms). **8.5x faster recompilation, 3.8x faster total training step.** 1,000-step endurance verified: 22 minutes wall time (vs ~85 min with full recompile), zero NaN, no memory leak.
- **LoRA Adapter-as-Input** *(complete)* — Low-Rank Adaptation where adapter matrices A, B are passed as IOSurface inputs. Compiler frontends generate `Y = conv1x1(x, W_base) + alpha * (x @ A) @ B`. Hot-swap verified: different adapters produce different outputs with zero recompiles. 17/17 tests pass. Discovered 3 new ANE constraints during implementation (#18-#20).
- **SwiftUI Demo App** — Deferred to Stage 3.

**Status**: 13/20 tasks complete. Delta compilation 7/7, LoRA 6/8 (2 deferred), Demo App deferred. Tagged `v2.0`.

### Stage 3 — Orion Platform *(future)*

Developer toolchain for building local AI applications on Apple devices. Model packaging, deployment, and a simple CLI/API:

```bash
pip install orion

orion train tiny mydata.txt
orion chat
```

### Packaging Roadmap

| Phase | Distribution | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Native binary (`clang && ./orion`) | Done |
| 2 | Makefile (`make && ./orion`) | Current |
| 3 | Python wrapper (`import orion`) | Planned |
| 4 | pip distribution (`pip install orion`) | Planned |

## Technical Discoveries

20 constraints discovered (6 from upstream, 14 newly documented by Orion). Full reference: [`docs/ane_constraints.md`](docs/ane_constraints.md). Hardware-level constraints (compile limit, weight baking, conv vs matmul) were first documented by [maderix](https://maderix.substack.com/p/inside-the-m4-apple-neural-engine-615); the rest were discovered empirically during Orion development:

**Compile/eval failures:**
- ANE rejects the `concat` MIL op — must use multi-output programs
- `gelu` is not a valid MIL op — decompose to tanh approximation
- ~119 compile limit per process — bypassed entirely by delta compilation (programs compiled once at startup, only reloaded during training)
- Minimum ~49KB IOSurface allocation — `seq_len=1` compiles but fails at eval
- Multi-output AND multi-input require **uniform IOSurface allocation sizes** — pad to max
- Weight dict must be `@{}` (empty dict), not `nil`, for weight-free programs
- `milText` must be `NSData*` (UTF-8 bytes), not `NSString*`

**Silent wrong data:**
- Multi-output surfaces ordered **alphabetically by MIL variable name**, not return tuple order
- Multi-input surfaces also ordered **alphabetically by MIL parameter name**
- ANE reads flat buffer as **packed shape data** — no stride adjustment for oversized surfaces
- SDPA causal masks are ignored — must decompose attention manually
- BLOBFILE offset is `uint64(64)` (chunk header), not 0 or 128
- Weights baked at compile time — overwriting BLOBFILE on disk doesn't change outputs (must reload)

**Compiler-level:**
- ANE MIL requires named const refs for matmul `transpose_x`/`transpose_y` — inline `true`/`false` rejected
- ANE MIL `conv` does NOT support `bias=` — bias must be a separate `add` op
- Output variable names must reference live nodes — dead names in return tuples cause InvalidMILProgram
