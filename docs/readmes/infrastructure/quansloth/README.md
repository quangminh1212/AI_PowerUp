> **Breaking the VRAM Wall:** Based on the implementation of **Google's TurboQuant ([ICLR 2026](https://research.google/blog/turboquant-redefining-ai-efficiency-with-extreme-compression/))** — Quansloth brings elite KV cache compression to local LLM inference.

Quansloth is a fully private, air-gapped AI server that runs massive context models natively on consumer hardware (like an RTX 3060). By bridging a custom Gradio Python frontend with a highly optimized `llama.cpp` CUDA backend, Quansloth achieves extreme memory compression, **saving up to 75% of VRAM.**

### 🛑 Why Quansloth? (No More GPU Crashes)
Standard LLM inference often hits a "Memory Wall" when processing long documents; as the context grows, the GPU runs out of memory (OOM) and the system crashes. 

**Quansloth prevents these crashes by:**
* **75% Cache Shrink:** Compressing the "memory" of the AI from 16-bit to 4-bit (TurboQuant).
* **Massive Context on Budget GPUs:** Run 32k+ token contexts on a 6GB RTX 3060 that would normally require a 24GB RTX 4090.
* **Hardware-Level Stability:** Our interface monitors the CUDA backend to ensure the model stays within your GPU's physical limits, allowing for stable, long-form document analysis without the fear of a system hang.

## 🖥️ OS Compatibility

- **Windows 10/11**: Fully Supported (via WSL2 Ubuntu). Features a 1-click `.bat` launcher.  
- **Linux**: Fully Supported (Native).  
- **macOS**: Not officially supported out-of-the-box (backend optimized for NVIDIA CUDA GPUs).  

---

## ✨ Features

* **TurboQuant Cache Compression:** Run 8,192+ token contexts natively on 6GB GPUs without Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes.
* **Live Hardware Analytics:** The UI physically intercepts the C++ engine logs to report your exact VRAM allocation and savings in real-time.
* **Context Injector:** Upload long documents (PDF, TXT, CSV, MD) directly into the chat stream to test the AI's memory limits.
* **Dual-Routing:** Auto-scan your local `models/` folder, or input custom absolute paths to load any `.gguf` file.
* **Cyberpunk UI:** A sleek, fully responsive dark-mode dashboard built for power users.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Windows with WSL2 (Ubuntu) **OR** native Linux  
- NVIDIA GPU with updated drivers  
- Miniconda or Anaconda installed  

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Prepare Python Environment

```bash
conda create -n quansloth python=3.10 -y
conda activate quansloth
```

### 2. Clone Repository and Requirements

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PacifAIst/Quansloth.git
cd Quansloth
```

### 3. Run Installer

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Adding Models

Download `.gguf` models (e.g., Llama 3 8B) and place them in:

```
models/
```

---

### Start Server (Windows - 1 Click)

- Use `Launch_Quansloth.bat`
- Double-click → auto-launches WSL, Conda, and server

---

### Start Server (Linux / WSL)

```bash
conda activate quansloth
python quansloth_gui.py
```

---

### Connect

```
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

---

## 🎛️ Pro Tips

- **Symmetric (Turbo3)** → Best overall compression  
- **Asymmetric (Q8/Turbo4)** → Better for Q4_K_M models (e.g., Qwen)  
- Monitor **Hardware Stats** for real-time VRAM savings
