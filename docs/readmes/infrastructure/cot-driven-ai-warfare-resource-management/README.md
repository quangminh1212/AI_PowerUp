# Nikosane/CoT-Driven-AI-Warfare-Resource-Management

CoT-Driven AI Warfare & Resource Management is a simulation where AI agents use Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning for military strategy, diplomacy, espionage, and resource management. The AI evolves over time using Deepseek R1 1.5B via Ollama, making adaptive decisions in a dynamic war-driven world.

# CoT-Driven AI Warfare & Resource Management

## 📌 Project Overview
**CoT-Driven AI Warfare & Resource Management** is a simulation where AI agents use **Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning** for **military strategy, diplomacy, espionage, and resource management**. The AI evolves over time using **Deepseek R1 1.5B via Ollama**, making adaptive decisions in a dynamic war-driven world.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Step Battle Planning:** AI generals simulate potential outcomes before attacking.
- **AI-Driven Diplomacy:** Entities form alliances, betray each other, or engage in peace talks.
- **Espionage & Deception:** Spies use misinformation and sabotage against enemies.
- **Resource & Economy Management:** AI controls logistics, war funding, and supply chains.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** AI learns from past wars to optimize strategies over time.
- **Persistent Memory:** Agent data is stored in **JSON files**, ensuring the simulation resumes from the last saved state on every run.


## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed. Then, install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **2️⃣ Set Up Ollama & Deepseek R1**
Follow the Ollama documentation to set up Deepseek R1:
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1-1.5b
```
### **3️⃣ Run the Simulation**
Execute the main simulation:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🔄 Persistent Data Storage
- **All agent memory and game state** are stored in **JSON files** under `data/`.
- The simulation **resumes from the last saved state** when restarted.
- Changes are automatically **saved after every turn**.

## 📚 Future Enhancements
- **AI-Self Learning:** Improve reinforcement learning for **adaptive tactics**.
- **GUI/Visualization:** Integrate **map-based war simulations**.
- **More Complex AI Strategies:** Evolve political systems within factions.
