## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 1. Fully Agentic Browser Control (Tool Calling)
Deepseek Browser Agent doesn't just read the page—it *controls* the browser! Equipped with autonomous client tools, the agent can:
*   **Scrape Page Text**: Extract the primary readable content from any webpage instantly for summary or analysis.
*   **Extract Page Links**: Gather, group, and map out all hyperlinks on the active document.
*   **Query DOM Structure**: Inspect CSS selectors and document layout structures.
*   **Click & Fill**: Interact directly with web buttons, inputs, and text fields.
*   **Navigate & Switch Tabs**: Dynamically browse to new URLs, search all open tabs, and switch focus between tabs under direct AI command.
*   **Highlight Match Query**: Search and highlight occurrences of specific keywords in the DOM.

### 🎨 2. Premium Glassmorphic Dual Themes
*   **Dark Mode (Default)**: Deep carbon backdrops with neon brand highlights and subtle glassmorphic blurs.
*   **Light Mode**: A beautiful, pristine, high-contrast off-white theme with fully refined alert contrast, soft card borders, and elegant brand color highlights.
*   **Shadcn Tooltips**: Customized Radix UI portals with an **instant 10ms hover delay** for fluid and responsive visual feedback.

### ⏱️ 3. Real-Time Security & Smart Navigation Guardrails
*   **Tab Switch Warning System**: Automatically alerts the user if the browser tab changes mid-session to protect active context.
*   **Smart Auto-Dismissal**: When switching tabs back to the original conversing webpage, the warning popup automatically and silently closes!
*   **Protected System Scopes**: Safely flags restricted browser domains (`chrome://`, `devtools://`, Chrome Web Store) where content script executions are locked.

### 💾 4. Session History & Settings Panel
*   **Auto-Saved Sessions**: Chat logs are preserved under local scopes (`website-specific`, `domain-level`, or `global`).
*   **AI Session Auto-Naming**: Generates creative titles for your conversation logs automatically.
*   **Cost & Usage Balance Tracker**: Directly fetch your Deepseek account balance, token allocation limits, and server statuses.
*   **Reasoning effort toggles**: Stream reasoning chain-of-thought CoT blocks and select from `Low`, `Medium`, and `High` reasoning effort levels.
*   **Detailed Tool Calls toggle**: Control whether detailed, collapsible tool parameters and execution results are displayed. When disabled, it condenses tool call logs into an elegant, professional separating element containing the exact action count (e.g. `--- 10 tool calls ---`), fading beautifully on both sides to keep the conversation clean.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Core Logic**: React 19, JavaScript (ES6+), Vite 8
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3, Vanilla CSS Post-Processing (for custom theme portals)
*   **Portals & Icons**: Radix UI Select & Tooltip Portals, Lucide React Icons
*   **Packaging**: Chrome Extensions Manifest V3 Specification

## 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

We love contributions! If you want to help make Deepseek Browser Agent even better, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Contribute
1.  **Fork** the repository and create your feature branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature
    ```
2.  **Lint your changes** before committing to ensure there are no ESLint syntax or purity errors:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
3.  **Validate your build** to guarantee compiling is 100% green and compatible:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
4.  **Commit** your changes with clear, concise, and structured commit messages.
5.  **Push** to your branch and open a **Pull Request** explaining your enhancements and visual verification.

### Coding Standards
*   **Purity**: Ensure all helper functions are pure and declared outside of React render contexts to prevent render-phase lints.
*   **Contrast**: When adding UI colors, ensure they adapt perfectly to both `.light` and `.dark` body classes (avoid hardcoded dark values in light mode elements).
*   **Accessibility**: Always wrap functional buttons inside `<Tooltip>` containers with instant delay duration parameters for optimal developer usability.

## 🗺️ Custom Skills & Extension Roadmap

We are planning to turn Deepseek Browser Agent into a highly modular, customizable AI copilot. Below is our active roadmap, focusing heavily on equipping the agent with dynamic **Modular Markdown Skills** and browser automation capabilities. We welcome any contributions or pull requests aiming to check off these items!

### 🔌 Modular Skills Engine (Markdown Skills)
*   **[ ] Markdown-Based Skill Files (`.md`)**:
    *   Equip the agent with the capability to read and execute custom modular Skill files written in Markdown (using standard YAML frontmatter defining name, description, and required parameters).
    *   Let developers and users drop new `.md` skill files into a `/skills` directory to dynamically register specialized workflows (e.g., code review, SEO optimization, form auto-filling) that the agent will read and run exactly as documented.
*   **[ ] Dynamic UserScript / Automation Skill**:
    *   Let users write or install custom JavaScript "skills" (similar to Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey scripts) that the agent can execute autonomously on specific domains.
    *   *Example*: An "Auto-Invoice Downloader" skill for Stripe billing portals.
*   **[ ] Model Context Protocol (MCP) Client**:
    *   Integrate an MCP client inside the sidebar to allow the Deepseek Browser Agent to communicate with local or remote MCP servers (GitHub, local databases, Google Docs, calendars).
    *   *Example*: Equip the agent with a "Local Terminal" skill or a "Database Query" skill.

### 🎙️ Advanced Interaction & AI Capabilities
*   **[ ] Visual Snapshot OCR & Image Decoding Skill**:
    *   Add a snapshot OCR decoding feature that will capture webpage elements or regions, use a 3rd party vision/OCR service (yet to be decided) to convert the images into detailed text descriptions, and feed them into Deepseek (since the current models do not support native image inputs).
*   **[ ] Real-Time Voice & Speech Skill**:
    *   Integrate Chrome's built-in Web Speech API (transcription & synthesis) to enable fully hands-free browser automation through voice commands.
*   **[ ] Cost-Efficiency & Token Dashboards**:
    *   Implement a visual card rendering exact token metrics, reasoning output tokens, cache hit rates, and total cost estimates per chat session.
