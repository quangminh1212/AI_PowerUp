**SafeSemantics** is a topological guardrail for AI apps and agents. Just plug and play the security layer of AI with an advanced knowledge base of how attackers penetrate and exfiltrate information through queries and prompts.

Unlike regex-based filters or LLM-as-judge approaches, SafeSemantics uses **FastMemory's topological clustering** to map the entire AI attack surface into a deterministic, queryable mesh — giving your agent structural understanding of threats, not just pattern matching.

### 🔬 The AI Attack Surface Mesh
SafeSemantics maps **14 AI security domains** and **141+ attack-defense rules** into a topological memory graph using FastMemory's CBFDAE (Component-Block-Function-Data-Access-Event) architecture.

## 📊 Verified Benchmark Results

All results are from actual test runs using [`benchmark.py`](benchmark.py) against curated attack prompts from public security research (HarmBench, JailbreakBench, OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS). Run `python benchmark.py` to reproduce.

| Benchmark | Result | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt Injection Detection** | **75.0%** (12/16) | Direct, indirect, encoding, delimiter, multi-turn |
| **Jailbreak Pattern Detection** | **87.5%** (14/16) | DAN, roleplay, hypothetical, crescendo, authority impersonation |
| **Data Exfiltration Detection** | **100.0%** (12/12) | PII extraction, system prompt, credentials, training data |
| **Agent Exploitation Detection** | **87.5%** (7/8) | Tool misuse, permission escalation, MCP abuse |
| **Overall Detection Rate** | **86.5%** (45/52) | Across all attack categories combined |
| **False Positive Rate** | **0.0%** (0/20) | Zero benign prompts incorrectly flagged |
| **Avg Latency** | **0.324ms** | P50: 0.282ms · P99: 2.866ms |
| **MITRE ATLAS Coverage** | **100%** (14/14) | All 14 defined AI attack tactics covered |
| **Knowledge Base** | **139 rules** | Across 14 security domains |
| **Offline / Air-Gap** | **✅ Full** | No network calls, no cloud dependencies |

> **Methodology**: 52 known attack prompts + 20 benign prompts tested via pattern matching against the SafeSemantics topology. This is a knowledge-base coverage benchmark — not a runtime ML classifier benchmark. Detection rates reflect how well the ontology's pattern signatures match known attack templates.

### Known Gaps (Areas for Improvement)
- **Encoded payloads**: Pure Base64/hex payloads without surrounding context are missed (75% PI rate)
- **Subtle multi-turn**: Benign-appearing first messages in crescendo attacks pass initial detection
- **Implicit tool abuse**: Tool call requests without explicit dangerous keywords can evade
- **No ML classifier**: Current detection is pattern-based; an embedding-based classifier would improve recall

> **Note on comparability**: SafeSemantics is a **knowledge-base + pattern-matching system**, not an ML classifier like Llama Guard or Lakera. Detection rates are not directly comparable across different architectures. SafeSemantics scores are from `benchmark.py` (52 attacks + 20 benign prompts). Competitor scores are from their own published evaluations on different datasets.

## 🤖 Securing Agentic AI Workflows

Agentic AI systems (like auto-coding bots or RAG agents) are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection and tool exploitation. SafeSemantics mitigates this by functioning as a dedicated "security memory layer" for your agent.

**How it works in practice:**
1. Your agent receives a complex, multi-turn user prompt or processes an external data source.
2. Before executing any code or triggering external tools, the agent queries the SafeSemantics mesh (via MCP or its static `safesemantics.md` context).
3. The topological mesh correctly identifies structural attack patterns (e.g., encoded payloads, roleplay jailbreaks, or hidden data exfiltration instructions) that simple blocklists would miss.
4. The agent becomes structurally aware of the threat footprint and autonomously rejects the malicious instruction, securing your AI pipeline without adding expensive LLM-as-judge latency.

## 🔌 One Skill to Secure All AI

Stop bolting on fragile regex filters and expensive LLM-as-judge layers. SafeSemantics replaces ad-hoc security with a single, autonomous topological skill.

### 🛡️ Dynamic Surface Auditing (AgentsID)
SafeSemantics natively integrates an AI-driven port of the [AgentsID Scanner](https://github.com/stevenkozeniesky02/agentsid-scanner). Written in pure Python (0 dependencies), your autonomous agents can use to the `scan_mcp_security_posture` tool to locally spawn, profile, and grade the execution permissions, injectability, and risk boundaries of *any external MCP server* natively before choosing to trust it.

```text
[TEST] Spawning target MCP server: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp
