<p align="center">
  <strong>Enterprise-Grade AI Platform for Salesforce</strong>
</p>

Build intelligent AI agents powered by Large Language Models that seamlessly integrate with your Salesforce environment. Designed for security, scalability, and ease of use.

Why Pluto? Because the point of this framework is not to be the loudest thing in the system. Its job is to hold the system together.

Pluto felt right because it is compact, memorable, and a little understated, but it still has gravity. That is the role this runtime plays inside Salesforce. It pulls agents, tools, channels, memory, and workflows into one coordinated operating model.

Whether people argue about the label or not, Pluto still does the work. That felt like the right attitude for a production framework.

## ⚠️ Repository Notice

This repository contains the **core Pluto framework only**. The `aiAgentStudioAddons` folder contains proprietary extensions not included in the open-source release.

The public package in `force-app` contains the core runtime, while the overall framework experience also includes broader packaged capabilities such as additional agent patterns, providers, actions, workflow composition, and UI features.

---

## 🎯 What is This?

Create AI-powered assistants that can:

- 💬 **Chat naturally** with users and remember conversation context
- ⚙️ **Run focused function-style automations** for classification, enrichment, and guided business tasks
- 📧 **Process email workflows** for triage, draft generation, and routing
- 🔍 **Search and retrieve** Salesforce data intelligently
- ✏️ **Create and update** records based on user requests
- 🔄 **Execute multi-step workflows** with approvals, sequencing, and specialist sub-agents
- 🔒 **Respect permissions** - agents only access what users can access
- 🎯 **Work with multiple AI providers** - OpenAI-compatible models, broader provider strategies, and enterprise options

---

## 💼 Use Cases

### Customer Support
Deploy AI copilots that help support agents resolve cases faster by automatically searching knowledge bases, pulling customer history, and suggesting solutions - all while respecting your existing security model.

### Sales Enablement
Give sales reps an intelligent assistant that can find accounts, surface open opportunities, create follow-up tasks, and provide real-time insights during customer conversations.

### Operations Automation
Build function-style agents, email workflows, sequential pipelines, and specialist sub-agent patterns for lead qualification, case routing, approvals, and record updates while keeping execution observable and governed inside Salesforce.

### Self-Service Portals
Embed conversational agents in Experience Cloud to let customers check order status, create support cases, or find answers from your knowledge base without waiting for human agents.

```

1. **User sends a message** through chat, email, SMS/WhatsApp/webhook, middleware-backed normalized ingress, or API
2. **Context is gathered** from the current record, user profile, and related data
3. **LLM analyzes** the request with full conversation history
4. **Tools execute** Salesforce operations (query, create, update, post)
5. **Response is delivered** back to the user with full audit trail

Public messaging/webhook traffic can first land in a normalized ingress boundary and optional staging object before the core runtime creates `InteractionSession__c`, `InteractionMessage__c`, and `AgentExecution__c`. When staged guest ingress is used, processing is handed off through a Platform Event subscriber configured to run as an internal user instead of continuing in guest context.

All operations run asynchronously using Platform Events or Queueables, ensuring scalability for enterprise workloads.

---

## 🏆 Why This Framework?

| Challenge | How We Solve It |
|:----------|:----------------|
| **Security concerns with AI** | Runs in user context with automatic CRUD/FLS enforcement. No privilege escalation. Full audit trail. |
| **Integration complexity** | Native Salesforce - no external servers, middleware, or data sync. Works with your existing org. |
| **Vendor lock-in** | Bring your own LLM. OpenAI-compatible APIs work out of the box, and the framework supports broader provider strategies for enterprise deployments. |
| **Scalability** | Async processing handles thousands of concurrent conversations. Choose Platform Events or Queueables. |
| **Customization needs** | Extensible architecture with interfaces for custom actions, context providers, and memory strategies. |
| **Governance & compliance** | Every interaction logged with a full execution trail. See exactly what the AI decided and why. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Salesforce org (Sandbox recommended)
- System Administrator access
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

**Option 1: Unlocked Package (Recommended for Quick Start)**

Install directly via package URL:

- **Sandbox & Scratch Orgs:**
  [https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tgK0000009qU1QAI](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tgK0000009qU1QAI)

- **Production & Developer Edition Orgs:**
  [https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tgK0000009qU1QAI](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tgK0000009qU1QAI)

After installation:
- Assign permission sets: `AIAgentStudioConfigurator` (for admins), `AIAgentStudioEndUser` (for users)
- Configure your LLM provider (OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible API)
- Create your first agent

**Option 2: CumulusCI (Best for Development & Testing)**

If you have [CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get-started.html) set up:

```bash
cci flow run dev_org --org dev
```

This single command:
- Creates a scratch org with the framework deployed
- Deploys seed data and sample configurations
- Assigns required permission sets (`AIAgentStudioConfigurator`, `AIAgentStudioEndUser`)
- Enables Knowledge user and assigns `KnowledgeDemo` permission set
- Creates comprehensive sample data (agents, capabilities, test records)
- Sets up a External Client App for API access

**Option 3: Salesforce CLI (Source-Based)**

```bash
sf project deploy start -d force-app/main/default -o your-org-alias
```

### Optional: Load Test Data

If you need sample data to explore the framework (especially with Option 1 or 3):

1. **Deploy the test data factory** from the `seed-data` folder:
   ```bash
   sf project deploy start -d seed-data/main/default -o your-org-alias
   ```

2. **Execute in Developer Console** (or via Anonymous Apex):
   ```apex
   AgentTestDataFactory.createComprehensiveShowcase();
   ```

This creates sample agents, capabilities, accounts, contacts, and test scenarios to help you get started quickly.

### Configure OpenAI API Key

The framework includes pre-configured OpenAI named credentials. You just need to add your API key:

1. Navigate to **Setup** → **Named Credentials** → **External Credentials**
2. Find and open **OpenAIEC**
3. Under **Principals**, click **Edit** on the principal
4. In the **Authentication Parameters** section, add:
   - **Parameter**: `OpenAIKey`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)
5. Click **Save**

The `OpenAILLM` named credential is now ready to use with the framework.

> **Tip**: The framework works well with OpenAI-compatible APIs and can be adapted to broader provider strategies for enterprise deployments. See the [Configuration Guide](https://iamsonal.github.io/aiAgentStudio/guides/configuration/).

### Setup

Once your API key is configured:

1. **Create or use existing LLM Configuration** (references the `OpenAILLM` named credential)
2. **Create AI Agent Definition** with identity/instruction prompts
3. **Add Capabilities** (tools) the agent can use
4. **Add Chat Component** to a Lightning page or use Quick Actions
