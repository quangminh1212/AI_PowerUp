# joaoariedi/ai-assisted-development-framework

A systematic Claude Code configuration for spec-driven development (SDD) with quality gates, custom agents, automated hooks, security guardrails, and a full specification pipeline. Balances security, performance, maintainability, and efficacy at every step.

# 🤖 AI Development Framework v5.2

> A Claude Code plugin for **spec-driven development**: write the spec, then the plan, then the
> code — with quality gates that are enforced by hooks rather than by good intentions.

---

## 🎯 What it is

Claude Code will happily write code from a one-line prompt. That works until the change is big
enough that "what were we building?" stops having an obvious answer — and then it fails quietly,
by building the wrong thing well.

This framework adds the missing middle. A feature goes **idea → spec → plan → tasks → code**, with
a human gate at each seam, and the pipeline refuses to skip ahead. Around that sit six specialist
agents, nine hooks, and a set of rules that load into every session.

The parts that matter are the ones you cannot talk your way past:

- ✅ **A `TaskCompleted` hook blocks a task from being marked done while the tests fail.** Not a
  reminder — a hook that exits non-zero and refuses.
- 🔐 **A pre-commit hook runs secrets detection and linting**, and blocks the commit if they fail.
- 🚧 **A plan-phase hook blocks edits outside `.specify/`** while a plan is being written, so the
  agent cannot start coding "just to check something."

Everything else — the agents, the skills, the research corpus — is support for that spine.

## 📦 Install

**Hand `SETUP.md` to an agent.** It is a runbook written for Claude Code to execute: it clones,
installs, configures the permission rule, verifies the result, and tells you what it did.

```bash
cd ~/some-project && claude
```

> Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaoariedi/ai-assisted-development-framework/main/SETUP.md
> and follow it to install the AI Development Framework on this machine.

Or do it yourself — it is three commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaoariedi/ai-assisted-development-framework.git ~/.claude-framework
claude plugin marketplace add ~/.claude-framework
claude plugin install ai-development-framework@ai-development-framework
```

Then **restart Claude Code** and run `/adf.context` in any git repository. It should print a
project summary. If it prints nothing, the permission rule is missing or wrong — that is the
single most common failure, and [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md) explains exactly why.

⚠️ **One thing the plugin cannot ship:** `rules/` and `CLAUDE.md` are not plugin components, so
installing does *not* give you the framework's global rules. Copy them yourself, and re-copy after
an upgrade — see [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md).

## 🗂️ Structure

| Directory | What lives there |
|---|---|
| 🛠️ `commands/` | The 18 slash commands. All namespaced (`adf.*`, `speckit.*`) so no built-in can shadow them. |
| 🕵️ `agents/` | Six specialist subagents — testing, quality, review, security, PR coordination, recon. |
| ⚙️ `hooks/` | Nine hooks, plus `speckit-helper.sh` (34 subcommands) that the commands call for live git data. |
| 🧠 `skills/` | Systematic debugging, effort estimation, performance audit. |
| 🔁 `workflows/` | `speckit-workflow.js` — executes a task list as a deterministic Workflow. |
| 📏 `.claude/rules/` | The rules loaded into every session. **Not shipped by the plugin** — copy them yourself. |
| 🧪 `tests/` | `smoke.sh` — the plugin's own test suite: 38 checks in CI, 42 with the live and end-to-end tiers. |
| 📚 `docs/` | Everything below. |

## 🚀 Using it

The pipeline is not all-or-nothing. Pick the path that matches the change.

### 🌱 1. A new project, from scratch

Full spec-driven development. Every gate, in order.

```bash
/speckit.init                        # bootstrap .specify/ — once per project
/speckit.constitution                # optional: project governance principles

/speckit.brainstorm  <idea>          # Socratic exploration — refine before committing
/speckit.specify     <feature>       # → spec: scenarios, requirements, success criteria
/speckit.clarify                     # ← HUMAN GATE: answers ambiguities in the spec
/speckit.plan                        # → implementation plan (writes blocked outside .specify/)
/speckit.review                      # ← HUMAN GATE: sign off on the plan
/speckit.tasks                       # → phased, dependency-ordered task list
/speckit.checklist                   # ← HUMAN GATE: requirement quality
/speckit.analyze                     # optional: cross-artifact consistency

/speckit.implement                   # TDD execution, red-green, one task at a time
/adf.quality                         # lint, types, secrets, SOLID — before you commit
```

For a **large** task list, swap the implementation step for the workflow, which runs independent
tasks in parallel and has every task adversarially verified by agents that did not write it:

```
ai-development-framework:speckit-workflow          # (full name required)
```

It **caps how many run at once** so a big task list does not self-inflict API rate limits
(`args.maxConcurrency`, default 4; `args.sequential` to force one at a time). It handles **monorepos**:
each task is routed to the repo that owns its files, with a separate test command and quality gate per
repo, so a spec in one directory can drive code in several. And it refuses to fake success — a run that
cannot mechanically verify a task **halts and says why** rather than reporting green.

It must be called by that full name; a bare `speckit-workflow` does not resolve. Run it only
**after** the human gates — a workflow cannot pause to ask you a question. Full argument reference:
[`docs/spec-kit.md`](docs/spec-kit.md).

### ✨ 2. A feature, in a project already set up

`.specify/` already exists. Skip the bootstrap and the constitution.

```bash
/adf.context                         # orient: stack, tools, structure, recent activity
/speckit.specify  <feature>
/speckit.clarify                     # ← HUMAN GATE
/speckit.plan
/speckit.review                      # ← HUMAN GATE
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement
/adf.quality
/adf.pr-summary                      # → PR description from the branch diff
```

### 🔧 3. A trivial fix

A typo, a config tweak, a one-line bug. The pipeline would cost more than the change.

```bash
/speckit.fix  <description>          # bypasses spec/plan/tasks entirely
/adf.quality
```

The hooks still apply. You cannot commit secrets or skip the tests just because you took the
short path.

### 🏚️ 4. Brownfield — existing code, no specs

Reverse-engineer the spec from what is already there, then proceed normally.

```bash
/adf.context                         # what is this codebase?
/speckit.init
/speckit.baseline  <module>          # → spec inferred from existing code
```

Read the generated spec before trusting it — it is inferred, not authoritative. Once you have
one, treat the module as scenario 2.

## ⚙️ What happens without you asking

The hooks ship with the plugin — you do not register them:

- ✏️ **On every edit** — formatters run; tests fire for the touched code.
- 🔐 **On every `git commit`** — secrets detection and linting must pass, or the commit is blocked.
- ✅ **On task completion** — the task cannot be marked done while the test suite fails.
- 🚧 **During `/speckit.plan`** — edits outside `.specify/` are blocked.

[`docs/hooks.md`](docs/hooks.md) explains each, and how to opt out deliberately when you must.
