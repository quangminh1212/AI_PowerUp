# LaneKeep

AI coding agents type `rm -rf`, read `.env` files, push to the wrong branch, and burn tokens in runaway loops. **LaneKeep intercepts every tool call and enforces deterministic rules before they execute.**

**171 default rules · 12 evaluators · zero network calls · Apache 2.0**

- **Live dashboard:** every decision logged locally
- **Budget limits:** usage patterns, cost caps, token and action limits
- **Full audit trail:** every tool call logged with matched rule and reason
- **Defense in depth:** extendable policy layers: 12 deterministic evaluators and an optional semantic layer (another LLM) as an evaluator; PII detection, config integrity checks, and injection detection
- **Agent memory/knowledge view:** see what your agent sees
- **Coverage and alignment:** built-in compliance tags (NIST, OWASP, CWE, ATT&CK); add your own
- **No data leaves your machine.** Every policy and rule is controlled by you.

Supports Claude Code CLI on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or Git Bash). Other platforms coming soon.

For more details see [Configuration](#configuration).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **bash** >= 4 | yes | Core runtime |
| **jq** | yes | JSON processing |
| **socat** | for sidecar mode | Not needed for hook-only mode |
| **Python 3** | optional | Web dashboard (`lanekeep ui`) |

```bash
sudo apt install jq socat        # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install bash jq socat       # macOS (bash 4+ required)
sudo apt install jq socat        # Windows (inside WSL)
```

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algorismo-au/lanekeep.git
cd lanekeep
```

Add `bin/` to your PATH permanently:

```bash
bash scripts/add-to-path.sh
```

Detects your shell and writes to your rc file. Idempotent.

Or for the current session only:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

No build step. Pure Bash.

### 1. Try the demo

```bash
lanekeep demo
```

```
  DENIED  rm -rf /              Recursive force delete
  DENIED  DROP TABLE users      SQL destruction
  DENIED  git push --force      Dangerous git operation
  ALLOWED ls -la                Safe directory listing
  Results: 4 denied, 2 allowed
```

### 2. Install in your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
lanekeep init .
```

Creates `lanekeep.json`, `.lanekeep/traces/`, and installs hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### 3. Start LaneKeep

```bash
lanekeep start       # sidecar + web dashboard
lanekeep serve       # sidecar only
# or skip both — hooks evaluate inline (slower, no background process)
```

### 4. Use your agent normally

Denied actions show a reason. Allowed actions proceed silently. View decisions in the **[dashboard](#dashboard)** (`lanekeep ui`) or from the terminal with `lanekeep trace` / `lanekeep trace --follow`.

## Managing LaneKeep

### Enable & Disable

`lanekeep init` registers hooks automatically, but you can manage hook registration independently:

```bash
lanekeep enable          # Register hooks in Claude Code settings
lanekeep disable         # Remove hooks from Claude Code settings
lanekeep status          # Check if LaneKeep is active and show governance state
```

**Restart Claude Code after `enable` or `disable` for changes to take effect.**

`enable` writes three hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) into your Claude Code
settings file: project-local `.claude/settings.local.json` if it exists, otherwise
`~/.claude/settings.json`. `disable` removes them cleanly.

### Start & Stop

Hooks alone work: every tool call is evaluated inline. The sidecar adds a
persistent background process for faster evaluation and the web dashboard:

```bash
lanekeep start           # Sidecar + web dashboard (recommended)
lanekeep serve           # Sidecar only (no dashboard)
lanekeep stop            # Shut down sidecar and dashboard
lanekeep status          # Check running state
```

### Temporarily Disabling LaneKeep

There are two levels of "disable":

| Scope | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Entire system** | `lanekeep disable` | Removes all hooks. No evaluation happens. Restart Claude Code. |
| **One policy** | `lanekeep policy disable <category> --reason "..."` | Disables a single policy category (e.g. `governance_paths`) while everything else stays enforced. |

To pause a single policy and re-enable it:

```bash
lanekeep policy disable governance_paths --reason "Updating CLAUDE.md"
# ... make changes ...
lanekeep policy enable governance_paths
```

To disable LaneKeep entirely and bring it back:

```bash
lanekeep disable         # Remove hooks — restart Claude Code
# ... work without governance ...
lanekeep enable          # Re-register hooks — restart Claude Code
```

---

## What Gets Blocked

See [Configuration](#configuration) to override, extend, or disable anything.

| Category | Examples | Decision |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Destructive ops | `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `truncate`, `mkfs` | deny |
| IaC / cloud | `terraform destroy`, `aws s3 rm`, `helm uninstall` | deny |
| Dangerous git | `git push --force`, `git reset --hard` | deny |
| Secrets in code | AWS keys, API keys, private keys | deny |
| Governance files | `claude.md`, `.claude/`, `lanekeep.json`, `.lanekeep/`, `plugins.d/` | deny |
| Self-protection | `kill lanekeep-serve`, `export LANEKEEP_FAIL_POLICY` | deny |
| Network commands | `curl`, `wget`, `ssh` | ask |
| Package installs | `npm install`, `pip install` | ask |

### Self-Protection

LaneKeep protects itself and the agent's own governance files from modification
by the agent it governs. Without this, a compromised or prompt-injected agent
could disable enforcement, tamper with audit logs, or bypass budget limits.

| Path | What it protects |
|------|-----------------|
| `claude.md`, `.claude/` | Claude Code instructions, settings, hooks, memory |
| `lanekeep.json`, `.lanekeep/` | LaneKeep config, rules, traces, runtime state |
| `lanekeep/bin/`, `lib/`, `hooks/` | LaneKeep source code |
| `plugins.d/` | Plugin evaluators |

**Writes** are blocked by the `governance_paths` policy (Write/Edit tools).
**Reads** of the active configuration (`lanekeep.json`, `.lanekeep/` state files)
are blocked by rules `sec-039` and `sec-040`. Exposing the ruleset would let
the agent reverse-engineer match patterns and craft evasions. LaneKeep source
code (`bin/`, `lib/`) remains readable; security of the engine is open, but the
active configuration is opaque to the governed agent. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#self-protection-governance_paths--rules) for details.

---

## How It Works

Hooks into the [PreToolUse hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) and runs every tool call through a tiered pipeline before it executes. First deny stops the pipeline.

| Tier | Evaluator | What it checks |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | Config Integrity | Config hash unchanged since startup |
| 0.5 | Schema | Tool against TaskSpec allowlist/denylist |
| 1 | Hardblock | Fast substring match; always runs |
| 2 | Rules Engine | Policies, first-match-wins rules |
| 3 | Hidden Text | CSS/ANSI injection, zero-width chars |
| 4 | Input PII | PII in tool input (SSNs, credit cards) |
| 5 | Budget | Action count, token tracking, cost limits, wall-clock time |
| 6 | Plugins | Custom evaluators (subshell isolated) |
| 7 | Semantic | LLM intent check: goal misalignment, spirit-of-task violations, disguised exfiltration (opt-in) |
| Post | ResultTransform | Secrets/injection in output |

The Semantic evaluator reads the task goal from TaskSpec. Set it with
`lanekeep serve --spec DESIGN.md` or write `.lanekeep/taskspec.json` directly.
See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#budget--taskspec) for details.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed tier descriptions and data flow.

## Core Concepts

| Term | What it is |
|------|------------|
| **Event** | A raw tool call occurrence: one record per hook fire (`PreToolUse` or `PostToolUse`). `total_events` always increments regardless of outcome. |
| **Evaluation** | An individual check within the pipeline. Each evaluator module (`eval-hardblock.sh`, `eval-rules.sh`, `eval-budget.sh`, etc.) independently examines the event and sets `EVAL_PASSED`/`EVAL_REASON`. A single event triggers many evaluations; results recorded in the trace `evaluators[]` array with `name`, `tier`, and `passed`. |
| **Decision** | The final pipeline verdict: `allow`, `deny`, `warn`, or `ask`. Stored in the `decision` field of each trace entry and counted in `decisions.deny / warn / ask / allow` in cumulative metrics. |
| **Action** | An event where the tool actually ran (`allow` or `warn`). Denied and pending-ask calls don't count. `action_count` is what `budget.max_actions` measures; when it hits the cap, the budget evaluator starts blocking. |

```
Event (raw hook call)
  └── Evaluations (N checks run against it)
        └── Decision (single verdict: allow/deny/warn/ask)
              └── Action (only if tool actually ran; counts against max_actions)
```

---

## Configuration

Everything is configurable: built-in defaults, user-defined rules, and
community-sourced packs all merge into a single policy. Override any default,
add your own rules, or disable what you don't need.

Config resolves: `$PROJECT_DIR/lanekeep.json` -> `$LANEKEEP_DIR/defaults/lanekeep.json`.
Config is hash-checked at startup; mid-session modifications deny all calls.

### Policies

Evaluated before rules. 20 built-in categories, each with dedicated extraction
logic (e.g. `domains` parses URLs, `branches` extracts git branch names).
Categories: `tools`, `extensions`, `paths`, `commands`, `domains`,
`mcp_servers`, and more. Toggle with `lanekeep policy` or from the **Governance** tab in the dashboard.

**Policies vs Rules:** Policies are structured, typed controls for predefined
categories. Rules are the flexible catch-all: they match any tool name + any
regex pattern against the full tool input. If your use case doesn't fit a policy
category, write a rule instead.

To temporarily disable a policy (e.g. to update `CLAUDE.md`):

```bash
lanekeep policy disable governance_paths --reason "Updating CLAUDE.md"
# ... make changes ...
lanekeep policy enable governance_paths
```

### Rules

Ordered first-match-wins table. No match = allow. Match fields use AND logic.

```json
[
  {"match": {"command": "rm", "target": "node_modules"}, "decision": "allow"},
  {"match": {"command": "rm -rf"},                        "decision": "deny"}
]
```

You don't need to copy the full defaults. Use `"extends": "defaults"` and add your rules:

```json
{
  "extends": "defaults",
  "extra_rules": [
    {
      "id": "my-001",
      "match": { "command": "docker compose down" },
      "decision": "deny",
      "reason": "Block tearing down the dev stack"
    }
  ]
}
```

`extra_rules` are **prepended** to the resolved rule set, so under first-match-wins they take precedence over overlapping defaults. To patch or disable a default rule by id (without copying it), use the `overrides` block — see REFERENCE.md § Customizing Default Rules.

Or use the CLI:

```bash
lanekeep rules add --match-command "docker compose down" --decision deny --reason "..."
```

Rules can also be added, edited, and dry-run in the **Rules** tab of the dashboard, or test from the CLI first:

```bash
lanekeep rules test "docker compose down"
```

### Updating LaneKeep

When you install a new version of LaneKeep, new default rules become active automatically. **Your customizations (`extra_rules`, `rule_overrides`, `disabled_rules`) are never touched.**

On the first sidecar start after an upgrade, you'll see a one-time notice:

```
[LaneKeep] Updated: v1.2.0 → v1.3.0 — 8 new default rule(s) now active.
[LaneKeep] Run 'lanekeep rules whatsnew' to review. Your customizations are preserved.
```

To see exactly what changed:

```bash
lanekeep rules whatsnew
# Shows new/removed rules with IDs, decisions, and reasons

lanekeep rules whatsnew --skip net-019   # Opt out of a specific new rule
lanekeep rules whatsnew --acknowledge    # Record current state (clears future notices)
```

> **Using a monolithic config?** (no `"extends": "defaults"`) New default rules won't be
> merged automatically. Run `lanekeep migrate` to convert to the layered format and keep
> all your customizations intact.

### Enforcement Profiles

| Profile | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `strict` | Denies Bash, asks for Write/Edit. 500 actions, 2.5 hours. |
| `guided` | Asks for `git push`. 2000 actions, 10 hours. **(default)** |
| `autonomous` | Permissive, budget + trace only. 5000 actions, 20 hours. |

Set via `LANEKEEP_PROFILE` env var or `"profile"` in `lanekeep.json`.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for rule fields, policy categories, settings,
and environment variables.

## Dashboard

See exactly what your agent is doing while it builds: live decisions, token usage, file activity, and audit trail in one place.

> **New here?** Start with **Insights** — it's the live decision feed showing every allow/deny in real time. **Governance** is where you set the budget and session caps that drive those decisions.

### Governance

Live input/output token counters, context window usage %, and budget progress bars. Catch sessions heading off the rails before they burn time and money. Set hard caps on actions, tokens, and time that auto-enforce when hit.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/readme/lanekeep_governance.png" alt="LaneKeep Governance — budget and session stats" width="749" />
</p>

### Insights

Live decision feed, denial trends, per-file activity, latency percentiles, and a decision timeline across your session.

</p>

### Audit & Coverage

One-click config validation, plus a coverage map linking rules to regulatory frameworks (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST SP800-53, SOC2, OWASP, CWE, AU Privacy Act), with gap highlighting and rule impact analysis.

</p>

### Files

Every file your agent reads or writes, with per-file token sizes to see what's eating your context window. Plus operation counts, denial history, and an inline editor.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/readme/lanekeep_files.png" alt="LaneKeep Files — file tree and editor" width="749" />
</p>

### Settings

Configure enforcement profiles, toggle policies, and tune budget limits, all from the dashboard. Changes take effect immediately without restarting the sidecar.

## Security

**LaneKeep runs entirely on your machine. No cloud, no telemetry, no account.**

- **Config integrity:** hash-checked at startup; mid-session changes deny all calls
- **Fail-closed:** any evaluation error results in a deny
- **Immutable TaskSpec:** session contracts can't be changed after startup
- **Plugin sandboxing:** subshell isolation, no access to LaneKeep internals
- **Append-only audit:** trace logs can't be altered by the agent
- **No network dependency:** pure Bash + jq, no supply chain

### Trace Privacy

JSONL traces under `.lanekeep/traces/` redact secrets before write. The
evaluator pipeline still sees the raw tool input — only the persisted
record is scrubbed.

- **`<private>...</private>` envelopes** in tool input are replaced with
  `[REDACTED:private]`. Wrap sensitive prose to opt it out of the audit
  trail without disabling tracing.
- **JSON values whose key ends in `_KEY` / `_TOKEN` / `_SECRET` /
  `_PASSWORD`** (case-insensitive) are replaced with `[REDACTED:keyname]`.
- AWS access keys, GitHub tokens, Anthropic / `sk-` keys, and
  `Bearer …` headers are pattern-matched and replaced with
  `[REDACTED:<type>]`.

See [REFERENCE.md § Trace Privacy](REFERENCE.md#trace-privacy) for the full
placeholder map.
