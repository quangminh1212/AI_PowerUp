Security guardrails and workflow policies for AI coding agents. Blocks dangerous operations at the hook level — not just as instructions.

## Supported agents

| Agent                                                               | Enforcement                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) | Shell hooks + settings.json + instruction file      |
| [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/hooks/)                            | Shell hooks + agent config + instruction file       |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com)                                        | Project-level hooks + rules/skills (via `.cursor/`) |
| [Grok](https://x.ai)                                                | Shell hooks (via `~/.grok/hooks/`) + AGENTS.md      |
| [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)                     | Instruction file only (no hook support)             |

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the full list of enforced rules.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew tap SumonMSelim/agentguard
brew install agentguard
```

### apt / deb (Debian, Ubuntu, WSL)

Download the latest `.deb` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SumonMSelim/agentguard/releases/latest) and install:

```bash
VERSION=1.3.0
curl -LO https://github.com/SumonMSelim/agentguard/releases/download/v${VERSION}/agentguard_${VERSION}_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i agentguard_${VERSION}_all.deb
```

Requires: `jq` (`sudo apt-get install jq`).

After installing via either method, install guardrails for your agent:

```bash
agentguard claude   # Claude Code
agentguard all      # All agents
```

### Manual

Requires: `bash`, `jq`.

```bash
# Clone once
git clone https://github.com/SumonMSelim/agentguard.git ~/agentguard

# Bootstrap the `agentguard` CLI (one-time only)
~/agentguard/install.sh claude   # one-time only: bootstraps the `agentguard` CLI wrapper into ~/.local/bin
```

The script installs the `agentguard` wrapper to `~/.local/bin/`. After this, use the `agentguard` command for everything:

```bash
agentguard claude   # Claude Code
agentguard grok     # Grok
agentguard all      # All agents
agentguard check claude
agentguard uninstall claude
agentguard claude --project --skills go,aws
```

If `~/.local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, add this to your shell profile:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Common options:

```bash
--dry-run                              # preview changes without writing anything
--skills none                          # skip skill packs
--skills karpathy-guidelines,other     # append specific skills only
--project                              # install to current project directory (skills only)
```

Re-running is safe — existing files are backed up with a timestamp suffix. `settings.json` is merged, not overwritten.

## Uninstall

```bash
agentguard uninstall claude
agentguard uninstall all
agentguard uninstall claude --dry-run   # preview first
```

Removes only what agentguard owns: hooks, instruction file, Kiro agent config, CLI wrapper. Claude `settings.json` is surgically unmerged — your own keys untouched, file not deleted.

## Check installation status

```bash
agentguard check claude
agentguard check all
```

Reports which hooks, files, settings, and CLI wrapper are present or missing. Exits 1 if anything is out of order — useful in CI to assert guardrails are in place.

## Disable per directory

For throwaway projects (pet projects, POCs, sandboxes) where you want the AI to have full access, disable agentguard for that directory:

```bash
# In the project root, in your shell (NOT inside Claude):
agentguard disable          # disable in current dir
agentguard enable           # re-enable
agentguard status           # show state for current dir

# Or target another path:
agentguard disable /path/to/poc
agentguard enable  /path/to/poc
```

Disabling adds the absolute path to `~/.agentguard/disabled-dirs`. Every hook reads that file on each tool call and short-circuits (no-op) when the active directory matches an entry or sits below one. Other directories keep their guardrails.

**Gated:** `agentguard disable` refuses to run inside a Claude Code session (`CLAUDECODE=1`), and the Claude `Bash(agentguard disable*)` permission is denied. The AI cannot disable itself — only you can, from your own shell. Re-enabling is open.

## Upgrade

```bash
agentguard upgrade
```

Pulls the latest agentguard, then uninstalls and reinstalls every agent you previously set up — in one step. Your personal settings and skills are preserved.

To check if an update is available without upgrading:

```bash
agentguard check claude
# prints an update notice if a newer version exists
```

## Skills

Skills are behavioural packs appended to the agent's instruction file at install time. `core` skills are included automatically; all others are opt-in via `--skills`.

| Skill                                                        | Tags   | What it does                                                                   |

### Global skills

Install once, active in every project. Best for universal practices that apply regardless of stack.

```bash
# Core skills only (default)
agentguard claude

# Add language/cloud skills globally
agentguard claude --skills go,aws,kubernetes

# Skip all skills
agentguard claude --skills none
```

### Per-project skills

`--project` appends skills to the instruction file in the **current directory** instead of `~`. No hooks or settings changes — skills only. Requires `agentguard` CLI (installed on any global install).

| Agent       | File written                                          | Notes                            |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in CWD                            |                                  |
| Codex       | `AGENTS.md` in CWD                                    |                                  |
| Cursor      | `.cursor/` in CWD (hooks + `AGENTS.md`)               | Always project-local; full install |
| Grok        | `AGENTS.md` in CWD                                    | Hooks global only (project rules supported) |
| Kiro        | —                                                     | Not supported; prints warning    |

```bash
# All agents at once — recommended:
agentguard all --project --skills go,aws

# Or per-agent:
agentguard claude --project --skills go,aws     # → .claude/CLAUDE.md
agentguard codex  --project --skills go,aws     # → AGENTS.md
agentguard grok   --project --skills go,aws     # → AGENTS.md (Grok loads it)
agentguard cursor --skills go,aws               # → .cursor/ (hooks + AGENTS.md)

# Preview without writing:
agentguard all --project --skills go,aws --dry-run
```

Claude Code loads both `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global) and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (project) simultaneously — project skills layer on top. Codex checks `AGENTS.md` in CWD first, then `~/AGENTS.md`. Cursor reads only the project-local `AGENTS.md`.

**Recommended pattern:** install `core` skills globally (guardrails apply everywhere), add language and cloud skills per project where relevant.

### Adding a skill

Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `tags`, `description`, `license`) followed by markdown content. Tag `core` to auto-include on every install. The installer picks it up automatically — no registration needed.

## Notes

- **Kiro** — guardrails only activate when using the `agentguard` agent. Switch to it in Kiro after install.
- **Cursor** — guardrails are project-local. `agentguard cursor` installs `.cursor/` into the current directory.
- **Grok** — native hooks via `~/.grok/hooks/agentguard.json` + shared scripts; global rules via `~/AGENTS.md`. Grok also loads Claude/Cursor locations for compatibility.
- **Codex** — instruction-only; no hooks, no automated enforcement backstop.
- **`block-env.sh`** — best-effort on the bash surface. `block-env-read.sh` is the primary layer (intercepts Read/Write/Edit tools directly).
- **Protected branches** — install prompts for which branches to protect from direct commit/push (default: `main,master`). Your answer is saved to `~/.agentguard/config` and applies across all agents. Override per-shell with `export AGENTGUARD_PROTECTED_BRANCHES="main,master,develop"`.
