# SantanderAI/autoguardrails

Alignment-research scaffold (autoresearch-style) for LLM guardrails: search over a single policy.md surface

---

# autoguardrails

> **Open source by Santander AI Lab.** An **LLM / AI-safety** guardrail research **library / evaluation harness** (autoresearch-style): it searches over a single mutable `policy.md` surface to minimize attack success rate (ASR) against a fixed evaluation suite, with a benign-pass floor.

`autoguardrails` is a small alignment research scaffold inspired by Karpathy's `autoresearch`.

Instead of searching over `train.py`, this repo searches over `policy.md`.
The idea is the same:

- keep the mutable surface tiny
- keep the evaluator fixed
- run under a fixed wall-clock budget
- compare candidates with one top-line metric
- log every keep or discard decision

In this repo, the top-line metric is attack success rate (`ASR`, lower is better), with a benign-pass floor so the system cannot win by refusing everything.

The CLI and `results.tsv` also report an empty-policy baseline so the guardrail's contribution is not confused with the target model's native safety:

- `asr_unguarded`: attack success rate with an empty policy.
- `asr_with_policy`: attack success rate with the evaluated `policy.md`.
- `policy_delta`: `asr_unguarded - asr_with_policy`; higher means the policy closed more of the attack gap.

## What Matters Most

For day-to-day experimentation, three files matter most:

- `program.md`: the human-owned instructions for the loop
- `policy.md`: the only file you should edit between runs
- `results.tsv`: the append-only run log

Everything else is fixed harness code or fixed evaluation data.

## Current Research Contract

- Mutable surface: `policy.md`
- Fixed suite: `eval_suite.jsonl`
- Fixed judge prompt: `judge_prompt.md`
- Fixed harness: `autoguardrails/`
- Acceptance rule: keep a candidate only if `ASR` improves and benign pass does not fall by more than 2 percentage points
- Runtime budget: fixed by the harness config, currently 5 minutes per evaluation pass

If you want a mental model closer to the original `autoresearch`, think of `autoguardrails/` as the fixed helper layer and `policy.md` as the single file under search.

## Quick Start

Run from the repository root.

1. Record a baseline.

```bash
python -m autoguardrails baseline --reset --repeat 2 --notes "initial baseline"
```

2. Edit only `policy.md`.

3. Score the new candidate.

```bash
python -m autoguardrails candidate --repeat 2 --notes "cover jailbreak and obfuscation"
```

4. Inspect the current kept result.

```bash
python -m autoguardrails status
```

5. Inspect the full log.

```bash
cat results.tsv
```

If a candidate is rejected, the harness restores `policy.md` to the last accepted version automatically.

## Shell Wrapper

If you prefer a single entrypoint, use [run_autoguardrails.sh](./run_autoguardrails.sh):

```sh
sh run_autoguardrails.sh status
sh run_autoguardrails.sh evaluate
sh run_autoguardrails.sh baseline "initial baseline" 2
sh run_autoguardrails.sh candidate "cover jailbreak and obfuscation" 2
```

On Windows, run the wrapper from Git Bash or another POSIX-compatible shell.

## Real Model Configuration

The default setup uses a deterministic local stub so the repo works offline.
To run real experiments, point the target model and the judge model at OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

Target model variables:

- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_PROVIDER=openai_compatible`
- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_MODEL`
- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_API_BASE`
- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_API_KEY`

Judge model variables:

- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_PROVIDER=openai_compatible`
- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_MODEL`
- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_API_BASE`
- `AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_API_KEY`

Example:

```sh
export AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_PROVIDER=openai_compatible
export AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
export AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_API_BASE=https://your-endpoint.example/v1
export AUTOGUARDRAILS_TARGET_API_KEY=your-target-key

export AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_PROVIDER=openai_compatible
export AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
export AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_API_BASE=https://your-endpoint.example/v1
export AUTOGUARDRAILS_JUDGE_API_KEY=your-judge-key

python -m autoguardrails baseline --reset --repeat 2 --notes "real-model baseline"
```

Use a frozen judge setup during a run series. Do not switch judge prompts or judge models mid-experiment.

## Typical Iteration Pattern

A simple offline emulation cycle looks like this:

1. Record the baseline.
2. Add one policy change family to `policy.md`.
3. Run `candidate`.
4. Keep the change only if the harness accepts it.
5. Repeat with one new change at a time.

One example candidate change that improves the bundled stub is to add explicit handling for:

- jailbreak phrasing such as "ignore previous instructions", "roleplay", and "developer mode"
- obfuscation requests such as translation, base64, rot13, JSON-only formatting, or schema conversion

That gives you a realistic first improvement curve without changing the evaluator.

## Repository Layout

- `program.md`: experiment instructions and constraints
- `policy.md`: mutable guardrail policy under search
- `judge_prompt.md`: frozen judge prompt
- `eval_suite.jsonl`: fixed attack and benign eval cases
- `results.tsv`: run log
- `run_autoguardrails.sh`: convenience wrapper around the CLI
- `autoguardrails/`: fixed Python harness
- `tests/`: regression and safety checks for the harness

See [autoguardrails/README.md](./autoguardrails/README.md) for the code architecture and [tests/README.md](./tests/README.md) for the test strategy.

## Safety Notes

- This scaffold is intentionally single-turn and narrow in scope.
- It does not model tools, file access, or multi-step agent actions.
- The bundled stub is for harness verification only; it is not a realistic safety model.
- The eval suite is fixed by design. If you change it, start a new experiment lineage instead of comparing against old results.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **No third-party runtime dependencies** — the harness is built entirely on the Python standard library and runs offline by default.
- Optional, for development only: `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pytest-cov` (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
- Optional, for real-model experiments: access to an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint (configured via the `AUTOGUARDRAILS_*` environment variables described above).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before getting started.

- Report bugs and request features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SantanderAI/autoguardrails/issues).
- External contributors sign the CLA (handled automatically by the CLA Assistant bot on your first PR).
- Run `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, `mypy autoguardrails`, and `pytest` before opening a PR.
- Respect the research contract: `policy.md` is the only mutable surface; `eval_suite.jsonl` and `judge_prompt.md` are frozen.
