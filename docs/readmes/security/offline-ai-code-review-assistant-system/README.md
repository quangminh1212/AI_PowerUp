## 🚀 Key Features

* **100% Secure & Offline**: No cloud APIs (no OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini calls). No network packets leave your computer.
* **Premium IDE Workspace**: Designed with a visual layout containing a collapsible sidebar, command palette modal search (`Ctrl+P`), and bottom system health panel.
* **Circular Health Gauge Dashboard**: Displays overall code health out of 100 with category metrics (Security, Quality, Maintainability, Performance).
* **SonarQube-Inspired Code Guide**: Redesigned right-pane code guides showing:
  * **Why Detected** & **Real-World Threat Consequences**.
  * **Standards Alignment**: Maps issues to **CWE-89**, **OWASP Top 10**, and **CERT** regulations.
  * **Side-by-Side Code Diff**: Visualizes Current Code vs Improved Code side-by-side with refactoring benefits.
* **Auto-Correcting Relative Paths**: Smart backend folder resolver translates dummy path inputs to actual absolute directories on your system automatically.
