# Sentrius

![Sentrius Dashboard](docs/images/dashboard.png)

**Sentrius** is a zero trust security platform for protecting your infrastructure. Monitor and control SSH connections, APIs, and RDP sessions with AI-powered agents, ensuring all access is secure and compliant with your organization's policies.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Deploy with Kubernetes (Recommended)

```bash
# Build Docker images (3-7 minutes)
./ops-scripts/base/build-all-images-concurrent.sh --all --no-cache

# Deploy to local cluster
./ops-scripts/local/deploy-helm.sh

# Access services
kubectl port-forward -n dev service/sentrius-sentrius 8080:8080
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Run Locally (Development)

```bash
# Build project
mvn clean install

# Start services (requires PostgreSQL and Keycloak)
./ops-scripts/local/run-sentrius.sh --build
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment options.

## ✨ Key Features

### Zero Trust Security
Enforce zero trust policies with continuous authentication, authorization, and monitoring for every connection.

### SSH Session Management
![SSH Session Management](docs/images/ssh.png)

Secure SSH connections with real-time monitoring, command filtering, and session recording. Access through the web UI or terminal.

### AI-Powered Agent Designer
![Agent Designer](docs/images/agentdesigner.png)

Create custom agents using natural language prompts. Agents can monitor sessions, automate tasks, and provide user assistance.

### Enclaves & Access Control
Group hosts into logical enclaves with role-based access control for fine-grained permissions and simplified security oversight.

### Dynamic Rules Enforcement
Define flexible, context-aware rules that adapt to real-time changes (user risk score, time of day, IP ranges).

### Self-Healing System
Automatically detect, analyze, and repair system errors through intelligent coding agents. Configure patching policies per service with built-in security analysis.

### External Integrations
Integrate with GitHub, JIRA, and LLMs through secure zero-trust proxies. All integrations use access tokens with granular permissions.
