# AgentDoG Family: Towards Diagnostic Guardrail and Scalable Alignment for AI Agent Safety and Security

## News

- `2026/05/28`: We have released [AgentDoG 1.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.29801), a lightweight and scalable agent safety alignment framework.
- `2026/04/16`: We have released [ATBench-Claw and ATBench-Codex](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.14858).
- `2026/04/02`: We have released [ATBench: A Diverse and Realistic Agent Trajectory Benchmark for Safety Evaluation and Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.02022).
- `2026/01/26`: We have released [AgentDoG 1.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18491), a diagnostic guardrail framework for AI agent safety and security.

## Introduction

AgentDoG 1.5 is **a lightweight and scalable agent safety alignment framework**, building on the foundation of AgentDoG 1.0. It extends agent safety diagnosis and alignment from fixed trajectory classification toward a practical framework for modern agentic systems with long-horizon planning, tool-mediated execution, complex environment interaction, and deployable runtime safety monitoring.

- 🧩 **Updated Agent Safety Taxonomy and ATBench Family:** revises the original three-dimensional safety taxonomy and supplements new risk types for Codex and OpenClaw agents, further extending ATBench into a broader benchmark family for trajectory-level agent safety diagnosis.
- 🛡️ **Lightweight AgentDoG 1.5:** proposes a taxonomy-guided data engine to train AgentDoG 1.5 with only around 1k training samples, achieving comparable performance with frontier open-source and closed-source models while maintaining lightweight deployment.
- 🚀 **Scalable Lightweight Agentic Training Pipeline:** builds a dedicated agentic SFT and RL training environment compatible with the proposed data engine, enabling low-cost and scalable safety-aware agent training, with a standard 8-core machine supporting over 10,000 concurrent agentic environments.
- 🧱 **Online Agent Safety Guardrail:** implements a practical runtime guardrail system based on AgentDoG 1.5 for real-world OpenClaw agent deployment, supporting online safety monitoring and intervention in deployed agentic workflows.

## ✨ Safety Taxonomy

AgentDoG adopts a three-dimensional safety taxonomy for trajectory-level agent safety diagnosis: **Risk Source**, **Failure Mode**, and **Real-world Harm**. This taxonomy separates where a risk enters the trajectory, how it manifests in the agent's behavior, and what consequence it may produce.

* **Risk Source**: where the risk comes from.
* **Failure Mode**: how the agent fails.
* **Real-world Harm**: what consequence the unsafe behavior may cause.

In AgentDoG 1.5, we reinterpret the taxonomy not as a static label space, but as a **shared diagnostic scaffold** for evolving agent execution settings. The three high-level dimensions remain fixed, while new settings can be supported through setting-specific customization and strengthened inherited categories.

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/safety_taxonomy_overview_v1_5.png" width="95%" alt="Three-dimensional agentic safety taxonomy"/>
</p>

---

## ATBench Family

AgentDoG 1.5 extends the original ATBench into a benchmark family for trajectory-level agent safety. The ATBench Family keeps a unified diagnostic protocol while adapting to different agent execution environments.

| Benchmark | Agent Setting | Description | Download |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **ATBench** | General tool-use agents | The base trajectory-level safety benchmark inherited from AgentDoG 1.0. | 🤗 [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI45Research/ATBench) |
| **ATBench-Claw** | OpenClaw agents with stateful tool/skill execution | Extends the benchmark to persistent sessions, accumulated traces, and stateful tool execution. | 🤗 [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI45Research/ATBench-Claw) |
| **ATBench-Codex** | Codex-style repository and command execution agents | Extends the benchmark to repository modification, shell commands, file operations, and code-execution risks. | 🤗 [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI45Research/ATBench-Codex) |

ATBench Family is designed to evaluate whether a guardrail can generalize from general tool-use trajectories to specialized agent environments. It also demonstrates how the three-dimensional taxonomy can be customized for new settings while preserving the same diagnostic interface.

## AgentDoG 1.5

In response to the risks introduced by emerging agentic AI systems, we develop a rationale-enhanced and cost-efficient construction framework, equipping AgentDoG 1.5 with rationale-generation capability, improving its safety judgment accuracy, and supporting low-cost deployment.

### Building Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/building_pipeline_v1_5.jpg" width="95%" alt="AgentDoG 1.5 building pipeline"/>
</p>

### Evaluation

AgentDoG 1.5 is evaluated on R-Judge and ATBench using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. We compare against closed-source models, open-source models, guard models, and AgentDoG-series models.

| Model | R-Judge Acc | R-Judge Prec. | R-Judge Rec. | R-Judge F1 | ATBench Acc | ATBench Prec. | ATBench Rec. | ATBench F1 |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| GPT-5.4 | 93.3 | 93.1 | 94.3 | 93.7 | 73.7 | 68.5 | 87.1 | 76.7 |
| Qwen3.5-397B-A17B | 85.6 | 81.3 | 94.5 | 87.4 | 66.8 | 65.5 | 70.2 | 67.8 |
| Qwen3.5-4B | 81.0 | 82.1 | 81.9 | 82.0 | 45.9 | 41.2 | 20.7 | 27.6 |
| LlamaGuard4-12B | 63.8 | 68.3 | 58.8 | 63.2 | 58.1 | 63.8 | 30.9 | 41.7 |
| Qwen3-Guard | 40.6 | 23.6 | 5.6 | 9.0 | 51.5 | 40.0 | 0.4 | 0.8 |
| AgentDoG-1.0-Qwen3-4B | 91.8 | 87.5 | 98.5 | 92.7 | 64.0 | 59.2 | 88.9 | 71.1 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-0.8B | 75.7 | 83.3 | 67.5 | 74.6 | 60.3 | 58.6 | 68.6 | 63.2 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-2B | 71.5 | 78.0 | 64.1 | 70.4 | 69.0 | 70.1 | 65.7 | 67.8 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Llama3.1-8B | 75.5 | 68.6 | 98.8 | 81.0 | 70.9 | 67.1 | 81.2 | 73.5 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-4B | 92.2 | 91.7 | 93.7 | 92.7 | 72.4 | 69.2 | 80.3 | 74.3 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-4B-U | 90.4 | 93.9 | 87.6 | 90.6 | 78.4 | 79.8 | 75.7 | 77.7 |

Fine-grained diagnostic accuracy on ATBench is reported along the three taxonomy dimensions. Guard models are excluded because they only output binary labels.

| Model | Risk Source | Failure Mode | Real-world Harm |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| GPT-5.4 | 33.6 | 13.5 | 30.2 |
| GPT-5.2 | 29.5 | 12.0 | 26.8 |
| Gemini-3-Flash | 18.4 | 8.3 | 15.0 |
| Gemini-3.1-Pro | 24.8 | 12.6 | 18.5 |
| Qwen3.5-397B | 7.7 | 3.6 | 6.8 |
| AgentDoG-1.0-Qwen3-4B | 46.8 | 16.5 | 40.6 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-0.8B | 65.7 | 18.4 | 44.9 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-2B | 68.0 | 24.0 | 53.8 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Llama3.1-8B | 72.9 | 24.6 | 52.5 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-4B | 75.2 | 27.5 | 62.9 |
| AgentDoG-1.5-Qwen3.5-4B-U | 24.1 | 9.5 | 28.4 |

Accuracy on ATBench-Codex and ATBench-Claw across model sizes. The x-axis uses dense model size and active parameters for MoE models; closed-source models are shown as high/low reference lines because their sizes are unavailable. Guard models use approximate backbone sizes with slight jitter, and Qwen3.5-0.8B/2B are omitted due to low strict-parser validity.

## Online Agentic Guardrail

AgentDoG 1.5 can also be deployed as an online agent safety guardrail. During agent execution, it can inspect accumulated trajectories before pending actions or final visible responses and flag unsafe behavior before it reaches the user or environment.

**Guardrail Design.** AgentDoG 1.5 can be placed before high-risk actions or final replies. It takes the accumulated trajectory as input and returns a safety judgment, optionally with fine-grained diagnostic labels.

Application materials are organized under [`Online Agentic Guardrail/`](Online%20Agentic%20Guardrail/).

## 🚀 Getting Started

AgentDoG 1.0 and AgentDoG 1.5 use different model checkpoints and prompt formats, so their deployment and inference instructions are maintained separately:
