The original. A local-first personal AI assistant that connects to 12+ messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, Teams, Google Chat, Matrix, BlueBubbles, Zalo, WebChat). Runs on your own hardware, model-agnostic (Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, Ollama local models). Uses `SOUL.md` for persistent agent identity and `SKILL.md` for extensible capabilities.

**Key architecture primitives:**
- Persistent identity via SOUL.md
- Periodic autonomy via heartbeat
- Accumulated memory across sessions
- Social context via MoltBook integration
