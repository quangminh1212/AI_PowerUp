def image_to_base64(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as f:
        image_data = f.read()
        return base64.b64encode(image_data).decode("utf-8")

# API configuration
base_url = "https://api.skyworkmodel.ai"
api_key = "your_api_key_here"

# Prepare the request
image_base64 = image_to_base64("path/to/your/image.jpg")
content = [
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_base64}"}},
    {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"}
]

# Call the API
response = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "model": "skywork/r1v4-lite",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": content}],
        "stream": False,

git clone https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Skywork-R1V.git
cd Skywork-R1V/r1v4
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Prepare Test Cases

```json
{"image": "./demo_image/demo_1.png", "question": "What's in this image?"}
{"image": "", "question": "This is a text-only question"}
```

#### Run Batch Tests

```shell
# Non-streaming mode (default)
python3 batch_nonstream.py

# Streaming mode
python3 batch_stream.py

# With custom input/output files
python3 batch_nonstream.py input.jsonl output.jsonl

# Using planner model for task planning
python3 batch_planner_nonstream.py
```

#### Visualize Results

```shell
# Start the web viewer
python3 visual.py

# Then open browser and input result file path (e.g., result_nonstream.jsonl)
```

#### Parse Structured Responses

```python
from parse_utils import parse_full_response

# Parse the response to extract reasoning steps, tool calls, and observations
parsed = parse_full_response(response_text)

# Access structured data
for round_data in parsed['rounds']:
    print(f"Round {round_data['round_num']}")
    print(f"Thinking: {round_data['think']}")
    print(f"Tool: {round_data['tool_call']['name']}")
```

### 4. Features
