```bash
# Already included, but if needed separately:
pip install huggingface_hub
```

#### 2. Login to HuggingFace Hub

huggingface-cli login

# Or set environment variable
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token_here"
```

#### 3. Using Remote Inference (Optional)

For lightweight usage without local GPU requirements, you can use HuggingFace's Inference API. Please provide your HF token to use it.

#### 4. Create Environment File

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration (optional):

```env
# HuggingFace Configuration
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
HF_CACHE_DIR=./models/cache

# Model configurations
CHATMUSICIAN_MODEL_ID=m-a-p/ChatMusician

```


### Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check GPU availability
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"

# Start the web interface
weavemuse gui
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

WeaveMuse provides flexible command-line options to launch different interfaces:

```bash
# Launch web interface (default)
weavemuse gui

# Launch terminal interface
weavemuse terminal

# For backwards compatibility, this also works:
weavemuse

# Show version
weavemuse --version
```

### Interface Options

#### 1. **Web Interface (GUI)** - `weavemuse gui`
- User-friendly Gradio web interface
- File upload capabilities for audio analysis
- Interactive chat with music agents
- Visual display of generated scores and audio playback
- Accessible (usually) at `http://localhost:7860`

#### 2. **Terminal Interface** - `weavemuse terminal`  
- Command-line interaction for advanced users
- Fast startup with on-demand loading
- Direct text-based communication with agents

### Model Configuration

When launching WeaveMuse, you'll be prompted to choose your model configuration:

```
🤖 Choose your AI model:
1. Only Local Models (Requires more resources and loading time)
2. HuggingFace cloud-based agent (some local tools - faster startup)  
3. All Remote (All models and Tools are remote - no resources needed)
```

**Important:** The backbone language model drives the intelligence of all WeaveMuse agents. When using smaller models due to computational constraints, expect the overall intelligence and reasoning capabilities of the system to be affected accordingly.

### System Architecture

WeaveMuse operates as a **multi-agent system** with specialized agents for different music tasks:

#### 🎯 **Manager Agent** (Main Controller)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates all music-related tasks
- **Capabilities**: Task routing, file handling, workflow management
- **Tools**: Base smolagents tools + specialized music agents
- **Think-act-repair**: The Manager agent follows Think-act-repair protocol.
- **Intelligence**: Driven by the backbone model (local or remote)

#### 🎼 **Specialized Music Agents**

**1. Symbolic Music Agent**
- **Tools**: NotaGenTool
- **Function**: Generates symbolic music in ABC notation
- **Output**: PDF scores, MusicXML, MIDI files, MP3 audio
- **Use Cases**: Composition based on musical periods, composers, instrumentation

**2. Audio Analysis Agent**  
- **Tools**: AudioFlamingoTool, AudioAnalysisTool (optional)
- **Function**: Advanced audio content analysis using NVIDIA Audio Flamingo
- **Capabilities**: Musical element identification, acoustic analysis, content description
- **Input**: Audio files (any format supported)

**3. Audio Generation Agent**
- **Tools**: StableAudioTool  
- **Function**: High-quality audio synthesis from text descriptions
- **Technology**: Stable Audio Open model
- **Output**: 44.1kHz stereo audio files

**4. Web Search Agent**
- **Tools**: WebSearchTool
- **Function**: Music-related information retrieval

### Performance and Intelligence Considerations

#### 🧠 **Model Intelligence Impact**

The **backbone language model** is the core intelligence driving all WeaveMuse agents. This model determines:

- **Task Understanding**: How well the system interprets your requests
- **Tool Selection**: Which specialized tools to use for specific tasks  
- **Workflow Orchestration**: How effectively multiple tools are combined
- **Response Quality**: The coherence and helpfulness of outputs

**⚠️ Important**: When using smaller models due to computational constraints (low VRAM, CPU-only mode), expect reduced intelligence across all agents:

- **Local Models**: Better reasoning but require more resources (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
- **Remote Models**: Good balance of intelligence and resource usage
- **Smaller Models**: Limited reasoning but faster and lower resource requirements


### Example Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Compose and Analyze Music
```bash
weavemuse gui
# User: "Create a baroque-style piece for string quartet and analyze its harmonic structure"
# System: Uses NotaGenTool → ChatMusicianTool → Returns score + analysis
```

#### Scenario 2: Audio Analysis and Generation  
```bash
weavemuse terminal
# User uploads audio file: "What instruments are in this recording? Generate something similar."
# System: Uses AudioFlamingoTool → StableAudioTool → Returns analysis + new audio
```

#### Scenario 3: Music Research and Composition
```bash
weavemuse gui  
# User: "Research Beethoven's late string quartets and compose something inspired by Op. 131"
# System: Uses WebSearchTool → ChatMusicianTool → NotaGenTool → Returns research + composition
```

#### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**CUDA/GPU Issues:**
```bash
# Check GPU availability
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"

# Install CUDA packages if needed

    inputs = {"prompt": {"type": "string", "description": "Input prompt"}}
    output_type = "string"
    
    def _load_model(self):
        # Implement your model loading logic
