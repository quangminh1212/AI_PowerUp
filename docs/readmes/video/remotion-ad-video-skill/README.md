Create Remotion ad video projects from a URL with an AI coding agent, no video-generation AI required.

# remotion-ad-video-skill

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

Create editable ad video projects from a URL with an AI coding agent. The skill
plans the ad, then renders with either [Remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion)
or [Hyperframes](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes). No video-generation AI required.

Remotion is the React/TS path. Hyperframes is the HTML/CSS/GSAP path. The skill
auto-selects the renderer from explicit user choice, existing project stack, and
local availability, then records the reason in `ad-brief.json`.

This is an agent-agnostic workflow: any coding agent that can read files and run
Node scripts can use it.

## Why This Exists

Most AI video workflows send a prompt to a video model and wait. This skill
takes a different path:

```text
URL -> source classification -> ad-brief.json -> assets -> storyboard -> render-engine code -> draft video
```

That makes the output editable, repeatable, brand-safe, and testable in code.
It is designed for ads where the product, CTA, claims, format, and asset rights
matter.

## Features

- URL-to-ad workflow for ecommerce products, mobile games, social/content apps,
  SaaS/API products, local services, and generic mobile apps.
- Mandatory `ad-brief.json` contract so source type, creative route, format,
  render engine, render-engine reason, audio mode, asset requirements,
  assumptions, and blockers are explicit before storyboard or code.
- Link-adapted preflight choices for output format and creative route.
- Audible generated SFX are used by default for draft ads unless you choose a
  silent-safe output; sound is not a required preflight question by default.
- Creative QA pushes bold ad layouts: poster-scale hooks, one dominant visual,
  aggressive crops, and lower text density.
- Ecommerce asset harvester with blocked-page detection and a fail-closed rule:
  if the product image cannot be confidently harvested, stop and request user
  assets.
- Fast Remotion lab for low-resolution stills, preview MP4, half-size draft
  MP4, and explicit full-size final render.
- Hyperframes compatibility with an HTML starter template, `variables.json`,
  and `npx hyperframes lint/inspect/preview/render` QA flow.
- Validation script for checking the skill package structure and key workflow
  contracts.
- Synthetic URL demo showing URL to Remotion ad video without third-party media.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm or another Node package manager
- Chrome or Chromium for browser-backed ecommerce harvesting
- For Remotion output: Remotion dependencies installed in the active project
  and a valid Remotion license for the intended commercial use
- For Hyperframes output: Node.js 22+ and FFmpeg for `npx hyperframes`
- Rights-cleared product images, logos, music, SFX, voiceover, and claims for
  production ads

## Agent Compatibility

The workflow is generic and can be used by any coding agent that can read local
files and run Node scripts.

- Codex / OpenAI-compatible skill loaders can install `skills/remotion-ad-video/`
  directly.
- Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or other agents can load
  `skills/remotion-ad-video/SKILL.md` as the playbook and use the scripts in
  `scripts/`.
- The deterministic parts are plain Node scripts plus Remotion and Hyperframes
  templates; they are not tied to one agent runtime.

## Install With Your AI Agent

You do not need to install this manually. Open your coding agent and ask it to
install the skill for you.

Copy this prompt:

```text
Install the remotion-ad-video skill from this repository into my available
skills directory. Use a symlink if my agent supports it; otherwise copy
skills/remotion-ad-video. After installing, tell me how to reload or restart the
agent so the skill becomes available.
```

For Codex/OpenAI-compatible agents, the agent should install
`skills/remotion-ad-video/` into the local skills directory, then ask you to
reload the skill list.

## Quick Start

Use it from your AI agent. Give the agent a URL and ask it to create an ad
video project:

```text
Use the remotion-ad-video skill to create a 15s ad video for this product:
https://example.com/products/focus-lamp
```

Or with the OpenAI/Codex skill trigger:

```text
Use $remotion-ad-video to create a 15s vertical ad video for:
https://example.com/products/focus-lamp
```

The agent should:

1. Classify the URL and create `ad-brief.json`.
2. Ask the two required creative preflight choices by default.
   If the agent supports selectable UI, it should use choices for size
   and creative route; otherwise it should ask only those same two options in
   text before any optional follow-up questions. Audio defaults to synced SFX.
3. Harvest or request usable assets.
4. Propose ad concepts and pick the strongest route.
5. Create or update the selected render project. The agent chooses by explicit
   user choice, existing project stack, then local renderer availability.
6. Run the matching render-engine QA before any final MP4.
7. Report rights, asset, and claim gaps.

For normal use, you should let the agent run the scripts, create the render
project, and render the draft. You do not need to run validation commands.

## Renderer Usage

Default auto-selection:

1. Explicit user choice.
2. Existing target project stack.
3. Local renderer availability.
4. Ask when both engines are available; recommend installing one when neither
   is available.

Use the remotion-ad-video skill with auto selection:

```text
Use $remotion-ad-video to create a 15s vertical ad for:
https://example.com/products/focus-lamp
```

Force Remotion:

```text
Use $remotion-ad-video to create a 15s vertical Remotion ad for:
https://example.com/products/focus-lamp
```

Force Hyperframes:

```text
Use $remotion-ad-video to create a 15s vertical Hyperframes ad for:
https://example.com/products/focus-lamp
```

Remotion output uses `assets/remotion-template/`, `src/default-props.json`, and:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run still
npm run render
```

Hyperframes output uses `assets/hyperframes-template/`, `variables.json`, and:

```bash
npx hyperframes lint
npx hyperframes inspect --samples 12
npx hyperframes preview
npx hyperframes render --variables-file ./variables.json --quality draft
```

## Synthetic URL Demo

The repository includes a safe demo at `examples/synthetic-url-ad/`.

It starts from a fake product URL:

```text
https://example.com/products/focus-lamp
```

The demo includes:

- `ad-brief.json` with the inferred ecommerce ad brief.
- `storyboard.md` with a 15s structure.
- `src/` with a CSS-only Remotion ad video.
- No third-party brand assets.
- No generated-video AI output.

Ask your agent to run it:

```text
Use the remotion-ad-video skill to run the synthetic URL demo. Install any local
dependencies needed for examples/synthetic-url-ad, render one still frame first,
then render the demo video if the still looks correct.
```

## Fast Render Workflow

When you want faster iteration, ask the agent to use the fast render workflow.
The important rule is simple:

1. Render low-resolution still frames first.
2. Render a low-resolution preview only if motion timing needs review.
3. Render a half-size draft MP4 for normal review.
4. Render full-size output only after you approve the draft.

Copy this prompt:

```text
Use the fast Remotion ad workflow: render low-resolution stills first, then a
half-size draft MP4 only if the stills are correct. Do not render full-size video
until I approve the draft.
```

## Recommended Agent Prompt

```text
Use $remotion-ad-video to turn this product or app link into a 15s ad.
Create ad-brief.json first, ask the two required preflight choices,
harvest usable assets, propose three concepts, implement the strongest one in
Remotion, render low-resolution stills before any MP4, and report rights or
asset gaps.
```

If you want a no-question speed run, say so explicitly. The agent can then use
inferred defaults, but it must still write them into `ad-brief.json`.

## Output Artifacts

A normal ad build should produce:

- `ad-brief.json`: source type, goal, CTA, creative route, format,
  render engine, render-engine reason, audio mode, assumptions, unresolved
  questions, and blockers.
- `public/<brand>/`: approved or harvested source assets.
- `src/default-props.json`: Remotion props for scenes, dimensions, CTA, assets,
- `src/default-props.json` for Remotion, or `variables.json` for Hyperframes:
  scenes, dimensions, CTA, assets, claims, and audio settings.
- Draft stills under `examples/<ad>/out/draft/`.
- Optional preview, draft MP4, and final MP4 under `examples/<ad>/out/`.

## Safety And Rights

- Do not imply this project grants rights to third-party product photos,
  screenshots, logos, music, voices, SFX, reviews, or store assets.
- Do not render unverified numeric claims, regulated claims, customer data,
  private URLs, API keys, tokens, or internal payloads.
- If ecommerce crawling is blocked or the main product image is not credible,
  stop and request user-provided product images.
- Drafts include generated SFX by default. Music, voiceover, or special sound
  assets still need clear usage rights when requested.
- Confirm Remotion licensing separately for commercial rendering and deployment.
  For Hyperframes, confirm the project can run Node.js 22+ and FFmpeg.

## Maintainer Checks

These commands are for maintainers and contributors, not normal skill users.

Run before publishing or opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run validate
```

Create a sanitized release snapshot:

```bash
npm run snapshot
```

Optional smoke tests:

```bash
node scripts/classify-ad-source.mjs \
  "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.king.candycrushsaga" \
  --title "Candy Crush Saga" \
  --brief-out /tmp/candy-ad-brief.json

node scripts/fast-ad-lab.mjs stills examples/example-ad --frames 30,150 --scale 0.25
```

## Maintainer Release Checklist

This checklist is for maintainers preparing a public release. Normal users do
not need it.

- Create a sanitized snapshot instead of uploading the working directory:

```bash
node scripts/create-open-source-snapshot.mjs
```

The snapshot is written to `dist/open-source-snapshot/` and intentionally
excludes `.remotion/`, `node_modules/`, render outputs, harvested media, local
task records, env files, and unreviewed examples. The reviewed synthetic demo is
included.

- Choose and add a `LICENSE` file before publishing. This repository does not
  choose one for you.
- Remove or ignore `node_modules`, Remotion `out` folders, caches, draft MP4s,
  and any generated screenshots.
- Review `examples/*/public/` before publishing; the default `.gitignore`
  excludes it because it may contain harvested or generated media.
- Do not publish local agent task records such as `docs/tasks/` or
  `docs/PROGRESS.md` unless they have been reviewed and sanitized.
- Remove third-party scraped media unless you have redistribution rights.
- Replace private product links, customer names, tokens, local absolute paths,
  and one-time IDs in examples or docs.
- Keep only examples that are either fully synthetic or explicitly licensed for
  redistribution.
- Run the validation commands above.
- Tag the first release as pre-1.0 if the API and workflow may still change.

## Limitations

- This is a skill and workflow package, not a hosted rendering service.
- The classifier is deterministic and heuristic-based; agents should still
  verify source context before production work.
- Ecommerce pages may block crawling. The correct fallback is to request user
  images, not to fabricate product visuals.
- Ad creative quality still depends on the brief, usable assets, and iteration.

## Contributing

Keep changes scoped and verifiable:

- Update or add reference files when the workflow changes.
- Prefer deterministic scripts for repeated or fragile steps.
- Run `npm run validate` before submitting changes.
- Do not commit generated render output, dependencies, secrets, or unlicensed
  third-party media.
