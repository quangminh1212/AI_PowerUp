## **The UGC Pipeline**

The main workflow. Generate a character, create an image, produce a video — all automated.

### **One-Shot (full pipeline)**

```
/ugc-video-auto

Create a UGC ad video with an attractive girl promoting my new vitamin C serum.
TikTok format, testimonial style.
```

Claude will:
1. Generate a photorealistic character image on Soul 2.0
2. Navigate to the Seedance 2.0 video page
3. Select the image from your generations
4. Write a UGC video prompt
5. Set ratio to 9:16 for TikTok
6. Ask for your confirmation, then click Generate

### **Step-by-Step (more control)**

**Step 1 — Generate the character prompt:**
```
/ugc-hot-girl

I need a girl for my skincare brand, early 20s, beauty/wellness vibe
```

**Step 2 — Create the image on Higgsfield:**
```
/higgsfield-image-auto

Use that prompt to generate the image on Soul 2.0
```

**Step 3 — Create the video:**
```
/seedance-auto-generate

Take that image and create a UGC testimonial video, 9:16 for TikTok
```

## **Using the Prompt Skills**

The 15 prompt engineering skills turn Claude into a specialized director for each video style. Each one generates **15-25 line production-grade Seedance 2.0 prompts** with:

- **2-second hook framework** — scroll-stopping openers
- **Timeline segmentation** — beat-by-beat breakdown up to 15s
- **Camera movement encyclopedia** — 15-20+ techniques
- **Lighting & atmosphere** — mood-setting setups
- **Sound design** — ambient, foley, music guidance
- **5+ example prompts** — ready to use

### **Examples**

```
/15-real-estate
Create a cinematic property tour for this luxury home [attach image]
```

```
/07-ecommerce-ad
TikTok ad for my wireless earbuds, premium unboxing feel
```

```
/01-cinematic
Epic opening shot, dramatic noir lighting, anamorphic lens
```

```
/08-anime-action
Turn this character art into a shonen-style battle scene [attach image]
```

---

## **Batch Runs**

Generate multiple assets in one session:

```
Generate 5 different UGC characters using /ugc-hot-girl and /higgsfield-image-auto:
1. Beauty/skincare — dewy, fresh-faced
2. Fitness — athletic, post-workout glow
3. Fashion — editorial, confident
4. Lifestyle — casual, girl-next-door
5. Luxury — elegant, minimal glam

Soul 2.0, 3:4 portrait, 2K. Update SESSION-RESUME.md after each.
```

### **Crash Recovery**

For long batch sessions, keep a `SESSION-RESUME.md` in your project:

```markdown
# Session Resume

## Progress

| # | Character | Image | Video | Status |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Beauty girl | ✓ | ✓ | Done |
| 2 | Fitness girl | ✓ | Pending | In Progress |
| 3 | Luxury girl | Pending | Pending | Queued |

## Next: #2 — video generation step
```

If Claude crashes:
```
Read SESSION-RESUME.md and continue from where we left off.
```

---

## **Optional: CLAUDE.md Configuration**

Add a `CLAUDE.md` to your project root for persistent settings across sessions:

```markdown
# Higgsfield UGC Pipeline

## Default Image Settings
- Model: Soul 2.0
- Aspect ratio: 3:4
- Resolution: 2K

## Default Video Settings
- Model: Seedance 2.0
- Duration: 8s
- Ratio: 9:16 (TikTok/Reels)
- Resolution: 720p

## Workflow Rules
- Always clear the prompt bar via JS before typing a new prompt
- Always screenshot after clearing to confirm it's empty
- Always ask for confirmation before clicking Generate
- Use @image1 in video prompts to reference the uploaded image
```

---

## **Technical Details**

### **How Image → Video Works**

No downloading or re-uploading needed. Higgsfield connects them internally:

1. Generate an image on `/image/soul-v2`
2. Go to `/create/video?model=seedance_2_0`
3. Click upload area → **Image Generations** tab
4. Click your image → green checkmark appears
5. Press Escape → image loads into the video form

### **The Prompt Bar Fix**

When running batches, the prompt bar doesn't always clear between generations. The skills handle this automatically, but if you're doing manual work:

**Image page** (standard input):
```javascript
const input = document.querySelector('[id="hf:tour-image-prompt"]');
input.value = '';
input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
```

**Video page** (Lexical editor):
```javascript
const editor = document.querySelector('[data-lexical-editor]');
editor.focus();
document.execCommand('selectAll');
document.execCommand('delete');
```

### **Model URLs**

| Model | URL Path |
|---|---|
| Soul 2.0 (best for portraits) | `/image/soul-v2` |
| Soul Cinema | `/image/soul-cinematic` |
| Nano Banana Pro (best 4K) | `/image/nano-banana-pro` |
| Nano Banana 2 (fast) | `/image/nano-banana-2` |
| Seedance 2.0 (video) | `/create/video?model=seedance_2_0` |

---

## **Common Issues**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `/mcp` doesn't show playwright | Run `claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'` and restart |
| Claude opens a new browser window | Normal — Playwright uses its own controlled browser |
| Prompt bar not clearing between prompts | Add the JS clear to your CLAUDE.md. Claude skips it if not explicit |
| Image doesn't load into video form | Make sure it shows a green checkmark before pressing Escape |
| Lexical editor won't accept typed text | Use `slowly: true`. The Lexical editor needs keypress events |
| Image prompt bar missing | Intermittent platform bug. Refresh the page |
| Not logged in | Log in manually in the Playwright browser window |

## **The Core Idea**

`CLAUDE.md` defines the rules. Skills define the expertise. Playwright gives Claude hands.

Instead of:

> Idea → write prompt → open Higgsfield → paste → configure → generate → wait → download → open video tab → upload → write video prompt → configure → generate → wait

You get:

> **Idea → Claude → done**

Define it once. Run it forever.
