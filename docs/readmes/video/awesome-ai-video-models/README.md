# Awesome AI Video Models [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> The most complete, up-to-date comparison of AI video generation models — **which model, via which API, at what price, and how fast.**

Unlike other lists that just dump links, this one answers the question developers actually have: *"I need to generate video — which model do I pick, and where do I call it?"* Every model below is mapped to the APIs that serve it, with indicative pricing, speed, and max resolution/duration.

> 💡 Prices are per **second of output video** (retail API rates verified July 2026) and move fast — always confirm against the provider. Latency is a rough "time to first result" at default settings.

## Open-source models (self-host or API)

| Model | Maker | License | Best for | APIs | Self-host VRAM |

## Task-specific: image-to-video

Most models above also do image-to-video (I2V). Strongest I2V specifically:

- **Kling 3.0** — best all-round I2V motion
- **Seedance 2.0** — best price/quality for I2V
- **Wan 2.2** — best open-source I2V
- **Luma Ray 3** — fastest I2V for iteration

## Avatar & talking-head models

Portrait/presenter video from a photo or actor + script. These bill by subscription or per-minute credits (not per-second like the raw generators), so the pricing column names the *model*, not a rate.

| Tool | Maker | Best for | API | Pricing model |
|------|-------|----------|-----|---------------|
| **HeyGen** | HeyGen | Studio avatars, dubbing | Yes (+ streaming SDK) | Credits / subscription |
| **Synthesia** | Synthesia | Enterprise training videos | Yes | Seat / subscription |
| **D-ID** | D-ID | Real-time talking portraits | Yes (streaming) | Per-minute credits |
| **Hedra** | Hedra | Expressive character audio→video | Yes | Credits |
| **Tavus** | Tavus | Conversational video agents | Yes | Per-minute |
| **Captions (Mirage)** | Captions | Fully generated AI actors | Yes | Credits / subscription |
| **Hour One** | Hour One | Scalable presenter video | Yes | Subscription |

Open-source alternatives: **OmniHuman-1**, **LivePortrait**, **EchoMimicV2**, **MuseTalk**, **OmniAvatar** (self-host, see repos).

## Real-time & interactive video

Emerging category — sub-second/streaming generation for games, live avatars, and interactive worlds.

- **Decart (Lucy)** — real-time world/video generation
- **Krea Realtime 14B** — open-weights real-time generation
- **LongLive** — long-duration real-time generation
- **PixVerse** — fast interactive generation
- **Hunyuan-GameCraft / world models** — playable generated environments

## Video upscaling & enhancement

Post-process generated (or real) footage — upscale, interpolate, denoise.

| Tool | Type | Best for |
|------|------|----------|
| **Topaz Video AI** | Commercial | Highest-quality upscale + interpolation |
| **FlashVSR** | Open source | Fast video super-resolution |
| **Video2X** | Open source | Free upscaling (waifu2x/Real-ESRGAN) |
| **REAL Video Enhancer** | Open source | Interpolation + upscaling GUI |

## Benchmarks & leaderboards

Don't trust a maker's own demo reel — check independent evals before committing:

- **[VBench / VBench-2.0](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench)** — 16-dimension automated quality benchmark
- **Artificial Analysis Video Arena** — Elo-style human-preference leaderboard across commercial + open models
- **Video-Bench** — human-aligned evaluation suite

## How to choose

- **Best realism / audio** → Veo 3.1 (Sora 2 works too, but its API sunsets Sept 2026)
- **Best value at scale** → Seedance 2.0 (~$0.03/s) or Pika 2.2 (~$0.05/s)
- **Fastest iteration** → Luma Ray 3 or LTX-2.3
- **Fully open / self-hosted** → Wan 2.2 (quality) or LTX-2.3 (speed)
- **Editing & creative control** → Runway Gen-4.5

## Where to run them (API providers)

Aggregators that expose many of the above behind one API/key:

- **[MuAPI](https://muapi.ai)** — unified API across image + video models (Kling, Veo, Seedance, Hailuo, Wan, and more), one key, one billing
- **[Fal](https://fal.ai)** — fast inference, broad model catalog
- **[Replicate](https://replicate.com)** — pay-per-run, large community model catalog

Native APIs (single-vendor): Google Gemini (Veo), OpenAI (Sora), Runway, Luma, Pika, MiniMax.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. When adding a model, keep the table columns filled — **a row without provider + price + speed isn't useful.** New models go in the correct table (commercial vs open-source) and stay sorted by relevance.
