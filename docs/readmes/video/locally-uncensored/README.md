## What is Locally Uncensored?

Locally Uncensored (LU) is a **free, open-source local AI studio** for Windows and Linux. It combines four things most local-AI tools keep separate — **AI chat, a coding agent, image generation, and video generation** — in one desktop app, and it installs like a normal program: run one installer, let the setup wizard detect (or install) an AI engine, one-click a model, start typing.

- **Uncensored by default** — first-class support for [abliterated models](https://locallyuncensored.com/blog/abliterated-models-guide.html) that answer directly, without refusals or lectures. Mainstream models are in the same menu.
- **100% local and private** — zero telemetry, zero analytics, works fully offline after model download. Cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Groq…) are optional and use your own keys.
- **Plug and play** — auto-detects 12 local backends (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, KoboldCpp, Jan, llama.cpp, LocalAI, GPT4All, TabbyAPI, Aphrodite, SGLang, TGI). Nothing installed? One click installs the engine for you.
- **Free forever** — AGPL-3.0. The models are open weights. No subscription, no credits, no rate limits.

**New to local AI?** Start with the [5-minute beginner guide](https://locallyuncensored.com/blog/how-to-run-ai-locally.html) — no command line anywhere.

## Download

Grab the latest release from [**Releases**](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases/latest):

| Platform | File | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Windows 10/11** | `.exe` (NSIS, recommended) or `.msi` | Fully tested, signed auto-update channel |
| **Linux** | `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage` | Packages on every release |
| macOS | — | Coming soon (source builds via `npm run tauri build`) |

> **Antivirus warning?** Some engines flag unsigned NSIS installers that download other binaries — a **false positive**. The installer is built by GitHub Actions from the public source on `master`, and the auto-update channel is signed against a public minisign key. Verification steps: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#antivirus--browser-false-positives).

**Current release: v2.5.8** (July 2026) — portable-friendly installers for Windows and Linux (no admin rights required), under the short in-app name **LU** by LU Labs. 2.5.8 rebuilds the Model Manager from scratch (the "Model Hub"), refreshes the catalog with 27 verified models, and adds local GPU lanes for four Create categories (talking character, music, extend video, motion control). Full history in [Releases](https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored/releases) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick Start

1. **Install** — download the installer and run it. No Docker, no terminal, no config files.
2. **Detect** — the first-launch wizard scans for all 12 supported local backends and offers one-click installs if none are running. ComfyUI (for images/video) is detected or installed the same way.
3. **Run** — pick a model in the Model Manager (hardware-aware recommendations, one-click downloads) and start chatting. Flip to the Coding Agent or the Create tab whenever you like.

## FAQ

**Is it really free and offline?**
Yes. AGPL-3.0, no account, no telemetry, no usage limits. After the initial model download the local stack works fully offline. Cloud providers are optional and bring-your-own-key.

**What does "uncensored" mean?**
Abliterated models have the trained-in refusal behavior removed from the weights themselves — not a jailbreak, nothing to patch or break. The model answers directly. Combined with local execution, your conversations stay private. [Full guide](https://locallyuncensored.com/blog/abliterated-models-guide.html).

**What hardware do I need?**
Text chat: 8 GB RAM. Fast 8B chat: a GPU with 6 GB VRAM. Image generation: NVIDIA GPU with 8+ GB VRAM. Video: 10–12 GB (image-to-video from 6 GB via FramePack F1). The app recommends models that fit your machine.

**Can it replace ChatGPT or Claude?**
For most chat, writing, and coding: yes, with a good 8–14B local model — private, unlimited, and refusal-free. Frontier cloud models are still stronger on the hardest reasoning; add them via your own API keys if you want both.

**Does remote access leak data?**
No. It's opt-in, passcode-gated, and shows connected devices. LAN traffic never leaves your network; away from home an encrypted Cloudflare tunnel connects phone and PC. No third-party AI server involved.

**macOS?**
Not yet — Windows and Linux today, macOS is on the roadmap. The source builds on macOS via `npm run tauri build` if you want to try.

**Next up:**
- [ ] Create-tab polish + new generation features (face-ID / PuLID, cleaner image & video workflow)

- [ ] Voice Mode (live voice conversations)
- [ ] macOS build
