# ASO Studio

> Self-hosted open-source App Store toolkit for indie iOS developers — **keyword tracking, screenshot generation, video pipelines, PPO experiments, and Apple Search Ads optimization**, all in one place. Pair it with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and you get an AI co-pilot that actually understands your App Store.

Stop paying \$500–999/mo to Sensor Tower / AppTweak / SplitMetrics / SearchAds.com. ASO Studio runs on your machine, uses public APIs where possible, and stores everything locally.

## What's inside

ASO Studio is a monorepo of **four** connected tools sharing one origin (`localhost:5173`) with a top-left app switcher:

| Tool | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Keywords** | `/` | Per-keyword, per-locale rank tracking across 50+ countries. Snapshot engine, week-over-week deltas, competitor intelligence. |
| **Screenshots / PPO** | `/studio/` | App Store screenshot generator with AI hero enhancement (fal.ai gpt-image-2). Templates, scaffolds, headline overlays, locale translations. Finished-preview (full-bleed) mode for pre-designed artwork, slide duplication, one-click iPhone→iPad sync. Multi-strategy A/B treatment generator for ASC PPO. |
| **Video** *(beta)* | `/video/` | UGC video pipeline for ad creative — script → voiceover → b-roll → captions. |
| **ASA Ads** *(new)* | `/asa/` | Apple Search Ads optimization — ROI projection, per-keyword bid intelligence, search-term cleanup, ASC trial cross-match, Telegram alerts. Self-hosted alternative to SearchAds.com. |

All four sub-tools share one Settings page and one local key vault.

### 💸 ASA Ads — Apple Search Ads optimization

![ASA Ads demo](asa-ads/docs/demo.gif)

What it does for your ASA campaigns:

- **ROI projection** — *"spend $1000 on this keyword/campaign → expect N installs, M trials, $X revenue, Y% ROI"*. Honest about data quality: `WAIT · need 3 more days` instead of fake numbers.
- **Bid intelligence** — per-keyword recommendations with high/medium/low confidence. Bulk apply or one-click `−10% / +10% / → recommended`.
- **Spend impact preview** — every bid change opens a modal showing projected daily/weekly/monthly spend delta + ROI verdict before you confirm.
- **Search terms cleanup** — auto-suggests negatives (terms with taps but no installs) and discovery candidates (terms that converted but aren't in your keyword list).
- **Geo heatmap + hero chart** — see which countries are winners at a glance.
- **Background sync** — start sync, navigate to another tool, come back to see the progress bar still ticking.
- **Telegram alerts** — 🔥 Burn, 💸 High CPI, ⚠️ Stalled, 📈 Spend spike.
- **Multi-app** — separate ROI/settings/recommendations per app.
- **Settings auto-suggestion** — `trial_to_paid_rate` computed from real ASC events (`Crossgrade from Introductory Offer` + `Billing Retry`).

## Why use it with Claude Code

ASO Studio is built to be driven by AI. Every editor state is a JSON file under `~/.aso-studio/` so an LLM agent can read/write it directly. Two MCP servers sit on top:

- **`asc-mcp`** ([dsm5e/nomly-asc-mcp](https://github.com/dsm5e/nomly-asc-mcp)) — full App Store Connect API: builds, versions, localizations, screenshots, in-app purchases, subscriptions, PPO experiments, custom product pages, reviews.
- **`apple-search-ads-mcp`** ([AppVisionOS](https://github.com/AppVisionOS/apple-search-ads-mcp)) — full Apple Ads (Search Ads) Campaign Management API v5: campaigns, ad groups, keywords, negative keywords, budget orders, reports.

What Claude can do for you (with these MCPs + this studio):

- 🤖 **Audit your ASO** — pull current title/subtitle/keywords across all locales, score them against competitors, suggest specific replacements.
- 🤖 **Run keyword research** — fetch competitor app metadata, analyze top apps for any keyword in any country, score difficulty/traffic ratios.
- 🤖 **Generate App Store screenshots end-to-end** — pick a preset, write headlines per locale, generate AI hero images, export PNGs for ASC.
- 🤖 **Run PPO experiments** — design 3 treatment concepts (palette / signature element / 3D break-out / story arc), generate 5-15 screens per concept, export ZIPs, create the ASC PPO experiment via API.
- 🤖 **Launch Apple Search Ads campaigns** — generate keyword lists from competitor research, set bids based on traffic/difficulty scores, create campaigns + ad groups + budget orders programmatically.
- 🤖 **Run ASA Ads day-to-day** — the ASA Ads sub-tool itself is agent-friendly (REST + SQLite). See [`asa-ads/README.md`](asa-ads/README.md#how-llm-agents-use-this) for the full API surface and example workflows: audit campaigns, find waste, apply bid recommendations in bulk, monitor live via SSE.
- 🤖 **Track campaign performance** — pull daily reports, surface wasted spend, suggest pause/scale/raise/lower-bid actions.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dsm5e/aso-tracker.git aso-studio
cd aso-studio
npm install          # registers all 4 workspaces
npm run dev          # launches all 4 tools in parallel
# open http://localhost:5173
```

All 4 tools share the same origin via the Keywords vite proxy:

| Tool | URL | Vite | API |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keywords | http://localhost:5173/ | 5173 | 5174 |
| Screenshots | http://localhost:5173/studio/ | 5180 | 5181 |
| Video | http://localhost:5173/video/ | 5190 | 5191 |
| ASA Ads | http://localhost:5173/asa/ | 5193 | 5194 |

First-time setup:
1. **Settings** (gear icon, top-right) — paste API keys you have. `FAL_API_KEY` is needed for AI image generation, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for translations.
2. **Keywords**: empty dashboard → **+ Add your first app**, paste your iTunes App ID, hit **Test connection** → **Add app & start tracking**.
3. **Snapshot**: pick a locale, add 5-10 keywords, click **Run snapshot** — watch live progress.
4. **Screenshots / PPO**: open the **Studio** tab → pick a preset → upload your simulator screenshots → write headlines or per-strategy prompts → generate.

## API keys & local storage

> **TL;DR — keys never leave your machine.** ASO Studio is a local-first tool. Every key you paste is stored in a single JSON file on your own filesystem, sent only to the upstream API it belongs to, and never to any backend we control (we don't run a backend at all).

### What's required

The studio uses two third-party APIs for its AI features. Both are pay-per-use; you only pay for what you generate.

| Key | Required for | Free tier? | Where to get |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FAL_API_KEY` | AI image generation (gpt-image-2) — Screenshots hero, PPO renders, Polish | $1 free credit on signup; ~$0.05 per medium-quality render after | [fal.ai/dashboard/keys](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Locale translations of headlines (gpt-4o-mini) | $5 free credit on signup; ~$0.0001 per headline after | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |

The Keywords tool (rank tracking) needs **no API keys at all** — it uses the public iTunes Search API.

### Where keys are stored

```
~/.aso-studio/keys.json   ← single file, JSON, mode 0600 (owner-only readable)
```

The `0600` permission means only your user account can read or write the file — not other users on the machine, not background processes running as different users. The studio's backend (`aso-screenshots/server`) is the only thing that opens this file, and it does so in-process (no network call).

When the studio needs a key, it resolves in this order:

1. **Environment variable** (`FAL_API_KEY=...` in your shell) — for CI / Docker / direct override
2. **`~/.aso-studio/keys.json`** — what the Settings UI writes to
3. **Throw** with a "configure key in Settings" message — never silently fails

### How keys are entered

In the Settings modal (gear icon, top-right):

- All inputs are `<input type="password">` — your screen never displays the key while you're pasting it.
- Click 👁 to reveal a draft (only the value you're typing right now, never an already-saved one).
- Once saved, the UI shows a **masked preview** (`fal_••••••AbCd`) and never round-trips the full key back to the browser.
- The "Clear" button removes the key from disk; env-var-set keys can't be cleared from the UI (clear the env var instead).

### What we DO NOT collect

ASO Studio has no telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporter, no remote config. The only outbound network calls are:

- iTunes Search API (for app metadata + keyword ranks) — no auth, no keys
- fal.ai API (when you click "Generate") — only with your `FAL_API_KEY`
- OpenAI API (when you click "Translate") — only with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`

There is literally no other backend in this stack.

## Examples

### PPO renders

Generated by the studio for [Dream Journal: AI Meanings](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6761296564) — three treatment concepts in different visual languages, all from the same source screenshots:

| A · Anxious Dreamer | B · Sleep Paralysis | D · Voice-First |
|---|---|---|
| painterly moonlit dreamscape, drifting feathers, navy + violet | dark horror, faceless shadow entity, crimson + black | high-energy kinetic motion, electric cyan + violet |
| ![A · Anxious Dreamer](docs/ppo/a-anxious-dreamer.png) | ![B · Sleep Paralysis](docs/ppo/b-sleep-paralysis.png) | ![D · Voice-First](docs/ppo/d-voice-first.png) |

Each treatment uses a locked **palette + atmosphere + lighting + signature element** anchor across all 5-7 screens, with composition variance (tilt, framing distance, 3D break-out elements) telling a story arc through the set. Prompts authored conversationally with Claude; renders done in batch via fal.ai's gpt-image-2.

### ASO Video pipeline

Three UGC ad creatives generated end-to-end by the video sub-tool — script → voiceover → b-roll selection → captions → endcard:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="docs/video/example-1.gif" width="100%"></td>
    <td><img src="docs/video/example-2.gif" width="100%"></td>
    <td><img src="docs/video/example-3.gif" width="100%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## LLM context

For AI agents working with this codebase, see [`llms-full.txt`](llms-full.txt) — full architectural context, file map, state schema, and command examples. Compatible with the [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) standard.

## Your data stays yours

- `config/apps.json` — your tracked apps (gitignored)
- `config/keywords/*.json` — your keyword lists per app (gitignored; only `*.example.json` committed)
- `data/rankings.db` — local SQLite with snapshot history (gitignored)
- `~/.aso-studio/` — keys, editor state, exports (outside the repo, mode 0600)

Nothing leaves your machine. You bring your own keywords, your own keys, your own creative.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express + better-sqlite3 + Sharp (image processing)
- **AI**: fal.ai (gpt-image-2 for image edits), OpenAI (translations)
- **Data source**: public iTunes Search API (no keys), optional App Store Connect / Apple Ads APIs through their respective MCP servers (your own auth)
- **Rate limit**: conservative 2 workers × 500ms sleep → ~240 req/min (Apple's limit is ~500). Auto-abort + Resume on persistent 502.

## CLI (headless snapshots)

```bash
npm run snapshot -- --app=dream                 # all locales for one app
npm run snapshot -- --app=dream --locales=us,tr,de
npm run snapshot                                 # every app, every locale
```

Streams line-by-line progress. Suitable for cron, CI, or Claude Code automation.

### Import existing jsonl snapshots

```bash
npm run migrate-jsonl -- /path/to/aso-rankings.jsonl
```

## Keyword methodology

Track **search phrases** (2-4 words) — what real users type into App Store search. Not single words from the Keywords field in ASC.

Localize by **intent**, not literal translation. Example: Turkish users search `rüya tabiri` ("dream interpretation") — not `rüya günlüğü` ("dream journal").
