## About

OpenLoaf is a local-first AI productivity desktop app built around **projects as independent workspaces**. Each project opens in its own dedicated window with a full-featured environment: AI assistant, file tree, terminal, task board, and canvas.

A **Secretary Agent** lives in the main window as your personal assistant — it can answer questions, manage your calendar and email, and route complex tasks to the right project's AI agent. For cross-project work, projects **link** to each other to share memory and skills.

> **Built natively into OpenLoaf:** the Secretary / Project / Worker agent system, project memory injection, skills discovery, runtime tool execution, and multi-window orchestration are all part of OpenLoaf's own product architecture - not a Claude Code reskin or thin wrapper.

### How It Works

```
You (the Boss)
  │
  ▼
Secretary Agent (Main Window — your personal assistant)
  │
  ├── Simple tasks → handles directly
  ├── Single-project tasks → spawns a Project Agent
  └── Cross-project tasks → spawns multiple Project Agents in parallel
        │
        └── Project Agent (Project Window)
              │
              └── Worker Agents (explore, plan, code...)
```

**Main Window** — your command center:
- AI Secretary for global tasks (calendar, email, cross-project queries)
- Activity timeline showing recent projects, conversations, and canvases
- Project grid to browse and open projects

**Project Window** — each project gets its own:
- Dedicated AI assistant with project-specific memory and skills
- File explorer, terminal, task board, canvas
- Links to other projects (their memory and skills are auto-injected)

## Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture

OpenLoaf's AI isn't a single chatbot — it's a **layered agent system** modeled after how companies work and built specifically for OpenLoaf's project-centric workflow:

| Agent | Role | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Secretary** | Your personal assistant in the main window | Global: calendar, email, project routing, cross-project queries |
| **Project Agent** | Dedicated assistant per project | Project: files, code, docs, terminal, tasks |
| **Worker Agents** | Specialized sub-agents spawned on demand | Focused: explore, plan, code, review |

The Secretary decides the most efficient path — simple questions get answered immediately, project-specific tasks get routed to the right Project Agent, and complex multi-project tasks spawn parallel agents. Agent roles, project routing, memory injection, skills loading, MCP access, and runtime tool execution are first-class OpenLoaf capabilities rather than a thin layer on top of Claude Code.

### Independent Project Windows

Each project opens in its own window (Electron) or browser tab (web). No context switching — work on multiple projects simultaneously with full isolation.

Projects are organized by **user-defined type labels** (e.g., "code", "docs", "knowledge base") which serve as visual groupings in the project grid. Types are just labels — the system treats all projects equally.

### Project Linking

Any project can link to any other project. When linked:
- The linked project's **memory** is injected into the current project's AI context
- The linked project's **skills** become available to the current project's agent
- Perfect for sharing a knowledge base, design system docs, or coding standards across multiple projects

### Memory & Skills System

Three-level memory hierarchy:

| Level | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **User** | `~/.openloaf/memory/` | Personal preferences, habits, global context |
| **Project** | `<projectPath>/.openloaf/memory/` | Project-specific architecture decisions, conventions |
| **Linked Projects** | Auto-loaded from linked projects | Shared knowledge (e.g., coding standards, API docs) |

Skills follow the same pattern — global skills plus project-specific skills, all discoverable by AI agents at runtime.

Skills are reusable Markdown workflows defined by a `SKILL.md` file. Put them in `~/.agents/skills/` for global reuse or in `<projectPath>/.agents/skills/` for project-specific behavior, and agents can load the instructions plus related tool dependencies on demand.

OpenLoaf also supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers. You can connect external tools over `stdio`, `http`, or `sse`, configure them globally in `~/.openloaf/mcp-servers.json` or per project in `<projectPath>/.openloaf/mcp-servers.json`, and import JSON configs from clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Cline, or Windsurf to expose GitHub, databases, filesystems, Slack, and more to your agents.

### AI Chat

Multi-model AI chat supporting **OpenAI**, **Anthropic Claude**, **Google Gemini**, **DeepSeek**, **Qwen**, **xAI Grok**, and local models via **Ollama**. AI is aware of your project's full context — file structure, document content, conversation history. Built-in memory lets AI retain knowledge across conversations.

### Infinite Canvas

A ReactFlow-based infinite canvas for visual thinking. Supports sticky notes, images, videos, freehand drawing, AI image generation, AI video generation, and image content understanding. Mind maps, flowcharts, and inspiration boards on a single canvas.

### Built-in Productivity Tools

Everything in one app — no more window-switching:

- **Terminal** — Full terminal emulator. AI agents can run commands with your approval.
- **Email** — Multi-account IMAP email with AI-powered drafting and summarization.
- **Calendar** — Native system calendar sync (macOS / Google Calendar). AI-powered scheduling.
- **File Manager** — Grid/list/column views, drag-and-drop, file preview (images, PDFs, Office, code).
- **Task Board** — Kanban board (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done) with priority labels and AI-powered task creation.
- **Rich Text Editor** — Block editor built on [Plate.js](https://platejs.org/) with LaTeX, tables, code blocks, and bi-directional links.

---

## Use Cases

- **Software Development** — Each repo is a project. Link a shared "coding standards" project for consistent AI behavior across all repos.
- **Research & Writing** — Create a "references" project as a knowledge base, link it to your paper projects. AI draws from your curated sources.
- **Content Creation** — Brainstorm on the canvas, generate images with AI, write in the editor, track deliverables on the task board.
- **Project Management** — One project per client. Secretary Agent gives you a cross-project overview. Calendar and email keep everything coordinated.
- **Personal Knowledge Base** — Accumulate notes, web clippings, and journal entries. Link to work projects so AI connects the dots.

## Why OpenLoaf

### The Problem

- **Fragmented AI workflows** — One thing done requires jumping between five windows.
- **No project context** — AI forgets everything between conversations. You re-explain your project every time.
- **Single-project silos** — Projects can't share knowledge. Your coding standards project can't help your code repos.
- **Cloud lock-in** — Your data lives on someone else's servers. You can't choose your own AI models.

### OpenLoaf's Approach

- **Self-developed agent stack** — The Secretary / Project / Worker architecture, memory pipeline, skills system, MCP integration, and tool runtime are built natively in OpenLoaf instead of being a Claude Code reskin or wrapper.
- **Project-centric** — Each project is a self-contained environment with its own AI agent, memory, and skills.
- **Linked knowledge** — Projects share context through explicit links. A knowledge base enriches every project it's linked to.
- **Multi-agent routing** — The Secretary Agent handles the orchestration. Simple tasks are fast; complex tasks get the right specialist.
- **Local-first** — All data stored locally (`~/.openloaf/`). Bring your own API keys. No telemetry, no tracking.
- **Ready out of the box** — Download, install, go. No servers, databases, or Docker.

### Loaf = Bread + Lounging

OpenLoaf's logo is a bread-shaped sofa. **Loaf** means both "bread" and "to lounge around" — hand off tedious work to AI while you make the important decisions.

---

## Privacy & Security

- **100% Local Storage** — All data stored on your filesystem (`~/.openloaf/`). Nothing uploaded to cloud servers.
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** — Configure your own AI API keys. API calls go directly from your device to the model provider.
- **Works Offline** — Core features work fully offline. Use Ollama for a completely air-gapped AI experience.
- **No Telemetry** — No analytics, no usage data, no tracking. What happens on your device stays on your device.
- **Open-Source & Auditable** — Full codebase under AGPLv3. Inspect every line that touches your data.
