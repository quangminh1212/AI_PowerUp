# Dental Insurance Verification AI Agent

## Introduction

An AI-powered system that automates dental insurance verification processes, capable of handling real-time conversations, accent variations, and data extraction. The system reduces verification time from 
14 minutes to near real-time processing while helping prevent claim denials.

## Industry Challenges & Impact

The healthcare industry faces significant verification challenges:

* Insurance denials are increasing for 70% of providers, with 27% of denials related to registration and eligibility issues. The system addresses these challenges by automating verification,
  potentially saving the industry $12.8 billion.

* Current industry statistics show concerning trends:
  * 90% of claim denials are preventable, yet denial rates average 8-10%
  * Denials constitute approximately 20% of practice expenses
  * Each claim resubmission costs between $25-$118
  * 65% of denied claims are never resubmitted
  * 69% of practices report increased denials, averaging a 17% increase
  * Manual verification requires up to 14 minutes per transaction

### Core Components

1. **Speech Recognition**
   * Leverages OpenAI Whisper for accurate transcription
   * Handles diverse accents and speech patterns

2. **Natural Language Processing**
   * Implements Gemini LLM for context understanding
   * Processes complex insurance-related queries

3. **Text-to-Speech**
   * Utilizes Coqui TTS for natural speech output
   * Provides clear, understandable responses

4. **Accent Handling**
   * Employs FAISS vector database for semantic search
   * Performs real-time accent correction
   * Uses HuggingFace Instruct Embeddings
   * Provides confidence scores for corrections

5. **Data Processing**
   * Generates structured JSON output
   * Integrates with PostgreSQL databases

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher (Recommended Python 3.10)
* Working microphone
* System-specific audio processing libraries

### System Dependencies

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev
```

#### MacOS
```bash
brew install portaudio
```

#### Windows
```bash
pip install pyaudio
```

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/newking9088/dental_office_ai_agent.git
cd dental_office_ai_agent
```

2. Set up Python 3.10 virtual environment:

**✅ Recommended: Using uv (Faster Alternative)**

i. Install uv first:
```bash
pip install uv
```

ii. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv

-- Activate: Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

-- Activate: macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

iii. Install dependencies (after activation):
```bash
-- Install using uv (much faster)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Traditional Method**

If you prefer using the standard Python virtual environment:

i. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
-- Windows/macOS/Linux
python -m venv .venv
```

ii. Activate virtual environment:
```bash
-- Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

-- macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

iii. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**
- The `.venv` directory should be added to your `.gitignore`
- Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed
- Always activate the virtual environment before installing packages

3. Setting Up Your API Key Securely

Recommended Method ✅

i. Create or modify the `.env` file securely:
   * Create the file (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   * Open the file in your preferred text editor
   * Add your API key:
   ```text
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
Alternatively, rename the example environment file and set up your API key (not recommended). Rename the example file:
```bash
mv api_key_example.env .env
```

ii. Set proper file permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 .env
```

iii. [Optional] Load the environment variables:
```bash
source .env
```

⚠️ Warning: Unsafe Method to Avoid

Avoid using the following method as it may expose your API key:
```bash
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'" > .env  # Not recommended
```

Why avoid echo?
- API key may be saved in shell history
- Key could be visible in process listings
- Risk of accidental file overwrite

Best Practices 🔒

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control

- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`

- Keep a clean example file (`.env.example`) for reference

- Regularly rotate your API keys

- Use different keys for development and production
