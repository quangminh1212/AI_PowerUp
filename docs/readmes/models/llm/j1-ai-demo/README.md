# AI-Powered Helpdesk System for MedicalAppointment App

MedicalAppointment is a demonstration platform consisting of multiple microservices that together form an AI-powered helpdesk system for a regular medical appointment app. Patients manage appointments and submit support requests through a web app. Those requests flow into a centralized helpdesk that uses AI triage, semantic similarity search, and company-policy document retrieval to classify, prioritize, and route tickets, as well as a coding assistant to automatically fix reported bugs.

### Request Flow


![Sequence Diagram](docs/sequence-diagram.png)

1. A patient submits a help request in the **user-facing web app** (:8083).
2. The request arrives at the **helpdesk** (:8080) as an incoming ticket.
3. Helpdesk calls the **AI triage** service (:8081) to classify and route the ticket with an AI confidence score. 
4. If *AI triage** responds with a confidence below **0.4**, the request is returned to the human review/dispatch queue.
5. AI triage enriches the result by additionally calling:
   - **Urgency service** (:8086) generates a priority score from a domain-trained machine learning model (built in Java with DeepNetts).
   - **Similar-tickets** service (:8082) performs vector search over historical tickets.
   - **Company-documents RAG** service (:8084) checks for policy/knowledge-base citations with RBAC
6. As AI triage returns classification (ticket type), urgency, confidence, and enrichments to helpdesk, this service further dispatches the ticket to a mapped team.
Tickets with urgency score >= 0.8 are considered critical and are escalated to an on-call employee.
7. If a ticket type is triaged as a bug, a job request is initiated to the coding assistant that can propose a PR to fix it.

Each service is independently deployable with its own `pom.xml`, `README.md`, and `CONTRACTS.md`.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Java 25+, Maven 3.8+, Docker.

For OpenAI-backed services, configure API key via either:
- `services/similar-tickets/config/config-prod.yaml` (`openai.api-key`)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

Preferred startup:

```bash
./start-all.sh
```

By default, UI event/activity log side panels are hidden. To show them and follow ticket paths throughout the services:

```bash
./start-all.sh -show-event-log
```

Set one zoom level for all service dashboards from startup:

```bash
./start-all.sh -ui-zoom=120
```

Both options can be combined:

```bash
./start-all.sh -show-event-log -ui-zoom=120
```

Run all tests across all services:

```bash
./run-all-tests.sh
```

`run-all-tests.sh` executes `mvn test` per service (unit-test scope). By default this does **not** run paid vectorization/API workflows. In particular, `similar-tickets` integration-style tests that need real OpenAI/Oracle are skipped unless explicit system properties are provided.

> [!WARNING]
> If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and you run the default `./start-all.sh`, demo loaders for similar-tickets and company-rag will run and trigger embedding/vectorization calls.
> Roughly, that is about **20k tokens total** on startup or approx. **$0.0026 USD** per startup with current embedding model settings.
> If you want to start without demo vectorization costs, run:
>
> ```bash
> HELPDESK_DEMO_DATA=false COMPANY_RAG_DEMO_DATA=false SIMILAR_TICKETS_DEMO_DATA=false ./start-all.sh
> ```

`start-all.sh` supports demo-data toggles via environment variables:

```bash
# Defaults (all true):
# HELPDESK_DEMO_DATA=true
# COMPANY_RAG_DEMO_DATA=true
# SIMILAR_TICKETS_DEMO_DATA=true

# Example: disable similar-tickets demo preload
SIMILAR_TICKETS_DEMO_DATA=false ./start-all.sh

# Example: disable all demo loading
HELPDESK_DEMO_DATA=false COMPANY_RAG_DEMO_DATA=false SIMILAR_TICKETS_DEMO_DATA=false ./start-all.sh
```

Manual startup order for development:

Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables before starting services that use embeddings/models.

```bash
# 0. Start the auxiliary services
docker compose up

# 1. User-facing app
cd services/medicapt-user-facing && mvn quarkus:dev

# 2. Helpdesk (needs MySQL connection)
cd services/helpdesk && mvn quarkus:dev

# 3. AI triage
cd services/ai-triage && mvn quarkus:dev

# 4. Similar-tickets (needs Oracle AI connection)
cd services/similar-tickets
mvn clean verify
java -DDemoData=true -jar target/similarity.jar

# 5. Company-documents RAG (needs Oracle AI connection)
cd services/company-rag && mvn quarkus:dev -Ddemo.data.load=true

# 6. Headless coding assistant
cd services/coding-assistant && mvn quarkus:dev
```

See each service's README for full setup details.

## Demo Notice

This is a demonstration system. Services use simplified data, have no real authentication, and simulate certain integrations. See each service's README for specific limitations.
