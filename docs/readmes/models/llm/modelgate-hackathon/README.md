# Aaryan-Kapoor/ModelGate-Hackathon

🏆Winning Project | ModelGate is a contract-aware AI control plane that ingests customer contracts, extracts SLA/privacy/routing constraints, and generates an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that automatically routes every request to the optimal model. Simple queries go to cheap models. Complex queries go to premium ones.

# ModelGate

**Intelligent AI Routing - Built from Your Contracts**

One line of code changed. Millions of premium calls rerouted.

ModelGate is a contract-aware AI control plane that ingests customer contracts, extracts SLA/privacy/routing constraints, and generates an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that automatically routes every request to the optimal model. Simple queries go to cheap models. Complex queries go to premium ones. Contract compliance is enforced per request, automatically.

**3rd Place** at the KSU Social Good Hackathon 2026 - Assurant Track.

### Team Agents Assemble

| | Role |
|---|---|
| **[Aaryan Kapoor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theaaryankapoor/)** | Lead Architect & AI Engineer |
| **[Pradyumna Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradyum-kumar/)** | Platform Architect & Frontend |
| **[Danny Tran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nam-tr%E1%BA%A7n-02973b2b6/)** | Design & Presentation Lead |

## Why

Over 30 new LLMs launched in the past month alone. No team has time to evaluate them all - so they pick one premium model and send everything to it. The result: 50-90% of enterprise AI spend is wasted on over-provisioned models, and premium models consume 180x more energy per query than small ones.

ModelGate fixes this. You change one line of code - your `base_url` - and we handle model selection, contract compliance, and cost optimization automatically.

## Results

### MMLU Routing Benchmark (60 questions, 6 subjects)

We benchmarked ModelGate against always routing to GPT-5.4 (default reasoning):

| | GPT-5.4 Direct | ModelGate Router | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Overall Accuracy** | 90% | 85% | -5pp |
| **Hard Accuracy** | 80% | 80% | 0 |
| **Cost** | $0.023 | $0.0095 | **-59%** |

The router sent 68% of queries to Gemini Flash Lite, 17% to GPT-4o-mini, and only 15% to GPT-5.4. Hard questions were routed correctly - the cost savings come from not overpaying on easy ones.

Projected at 10k requests/month: **$1.58 vs $3.83** (59% savings).

### Fine-Tuned Classification Model (GRPO Reinforcement Learning)

We fine-tuned ModelGate-Router (based on Arch-Router-1.5B) using GRPO to fix a critical blind spot: the stock model misclassified 86% of medium-complexity queries as complex.

| Tier | Stock | Fine-Tuned | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple | 87.9% | 81.8% | -6.1pp |
| **Medium** | **14.3%** | **85.7%** | **+71.4pp** |
| Complex | 100% | 85.7% | -14.3pp |
| **Overall** | **70.4%** | **83.3%** | **+13.0pp** |

- **Training:** 2.5 minutes, 150 steps, 172 labeled prompts, LoRA rank 32 (2.3% of params)
- **Hardware:** RTX 3080 Laptop, 8GB VRAM
- **Inference:** GGUF Q8_0 quantized to 1.6 GB, runs at **62ms** per classification (3.2x faster than FP16)
- **Eval:** 54 held-out prompts, zero overlap with training data

## How It Works

```
Contract (PDF/text) → LLM extracts constraints → Customer AI Profile → OpenAI-compatible endpoint
                                                                              ↓
                                                                    Prompt received
                                                                              ↓
                                                              ModelGate-Router classifies
                                                              (simple / medium / complex)
                                                                              ↓
                                                              Route to optimal model
                                                              per contract constraints
```

1. **Upload** a customer contract (SLA, privacy docs, compliance requirements)
2. **Extract** - an LLM analyzes the contract and produces a structured customer profile (region restrictions, allowed providers, latency targets, cost sensitivity)
3. **Route** - each request is classified by the fine-tuned 1.5B router (~62ms) and sent to the cheapest model that satisfies all contract constraints
4. **Monitor** - dashboard shows routing decisions, model distribution, cost savings, and per-request traces
