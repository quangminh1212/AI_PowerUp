Lightweight Conversational AI running on WebGPU

---

# Lightweight Conversational AI with WebGPU 

This project demonstrates an innovative architecture for deploying lightweight, optimized large language models (LLMs) in web applications. By leveraging the WebGPU web API, the solution enables efficient inference on client-side devices, promoting energy efficiency and sustainability in conversational AI. This demo is created for ICCRET 2025 paper submission.

## Features

- **Client-Side Inference**: Utilizes WebGPU API for running models directly in the browser.
- **Optimized Model**: Uses the Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Svelte.js for a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SouZe-San/webllm-bot.git
cd webllm-bot
bun install
```

## Usage

Run the application locally:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the demo customer support site and the chatbot.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the teams behind the [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) JavaScript Library, which facilitated the integration of pre-compiled models and loading to WebGPU.
