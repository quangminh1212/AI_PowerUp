# Mayo 🦾🤖
### The Autonomous Triple-AI Maintainer

Mayo is a **Self-Improving Autonomous Maintenance Engine** integrated directly into your GitHub ecosystem. It uses a **Triple-AI Pipeline** — three specialized AI models working in concert — to produce high-value, validated code improvements across all your repositories.

---

## 🧬 Triple-AI Pipeline

Every improvement goes through 3 AI models before it becomes a PR:

```

| Role | Model(s) Used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 🔭 **Scanner** | Fireworks AI (Llama 3.3 70B), Gemini 2.5 Flash | Reads full codebase → text-only analysis (zero compaction risk) |
| ⚡ **Executor** | Fireworks AI (Llama 3.3 70B), Groq (Llama 3.1 8B), Gemini 2.5 Flash | Receives plan → produces surgical search/replace edits |
| 🛡️ **Reviewer** | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Validates edits, corrects mistakes, audits PR review history |
| 🆕 **NewCrons** | Fireworks AI (Llama 3.3 70B), Gemini 2.5 Flash | Handles timed phases (PR/issue judging, proactive issues, discussions) |

---

## 🧠 Cross-Repo Global Memory

Unlike standard AI bots, Mayo has **persistent memory**:
- Tracks successes, failures, and "lessons learned" across all repositories.
- Insights from Repo A directly improve work on Repo B.
- The Reviewer audits real PR states (merged/closed/commented) and updates memory automatically.

---

## 🩺 Surgical Precision

The Executor uses a **Search/Replace block system** (max 10 lines per block). This guarantees:
- **100% preservation** of your original code structure.
- **Zero hallucination** of unrelated code.
- **Validated PRs** — every edit is reviewed by the Reviewer before creation.

---

## 🏗️ Analysis Depth

The Scanner performs a rigorous multi-layered analysis:
1. **Security**: Injections, hardcoded secrets, missing validation
2. **Logic**: Edge cases, null checks, error handling
3. **DX**: Missing READMEs, build guides, setup docs
4. **Performance**: Redundant calls, memory leaks
5. **Consistency**: Naming, patterns, style
6. **Creative**: Proactive "expert touches"

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

> **⚠️ FORK BEFORE USING**
> 
> This repo contains hardcoded references to my personal accounts, API keys, GitHub App configuration, and other credentials scattered throughout the codebase. **Do not use this repo directly.**
> 
> To use Mayo:
> 1. **Fork this repo**
> 2. **Search and replace** all personal references:
>    - `HOLYKEYZ` → your GitHub username
>    - `ayandajoseph390@gmail.com` → your email
>    - `joe-gemini-bot` → your bot name
>    - `mayo` → your bot repo name
>    - All API keys/env vars → your own keys
> 3. **Set up your own GitHub App** and add secrets to your repo
> 4. **Update the workflow file** (`.github/workflows/cron.yml`) with your secrets

### Environment Variables

> *a quick, self-deprecating note: yes, my API key setup is a bit chaotic. i'm broke and use multiple free tiers that don't always play nice together, so i've had to get creative with fallbacks. if you're not as financially challenged, you can simplify by using fewer, more robust keys and adjusting the `api/index.py` and `run_cron.py` files accordingly.*

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Primary Gemini key (for Scanner/Reviewer) |
| `GEMINI_FALLBACK_API_KEY` | Secondary key (often a Fireworks AI key in my setup, used as fallback for Scanner/NewCrons) |
| `GEMINI_NEWCRONS_API_KEY` | Dedicated key for NewCrons phases (can be Gemini or Fireworks) |
| `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` | Primary Fireworks AI key (for Executor) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Primary Groq key (for Executor) |
| `GROK_2ND_EXECUTOR_API_KEY` | Secondary Groq key (for Executor fallback) |
| `GEMINI_EXECUTOR_API_KEY` | Dedicated Gemini key for Executor fallback |
| `GEMINI3_FALLBACK_API_KEY` | Tertiary Gemini key for Executor fallback |
| `APP_ID` / `PRIVATE_KEY` | GitHub App authentication |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Vercel webhook secret |
| `BOT_REPO_NAME` | Your bot's repository name (e.g., `HOLYKEYZ/mayo`) |
| `CO_AUTHOR_NAME` / `CO_AUTHOR_EMAIL` | Your name/email for co-authored commits |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Hourly cron trigger authorization |

### Deployment
1. Deploy as a **GitHub App** on **Vercel**.
2. Point webhook to `https://your-app.vercel.app/webhook`.
3. Install on your repositories.
4. The hourly cron (`.github/workflows/cron.yml`) handles the rest.
