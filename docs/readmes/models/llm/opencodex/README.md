# HackWidMaddy/OpenCodex

A community-driven autonomous coding agent built for developers who want full control. OpenCodex helps you write, edit, debug, and ship code directly from your terminal or IDE using powerful AI workflows, local model support, and transparent execution. Built open-source, for builders who prefer freedom over black boxes.

# OpenCodex

OpenCodex is a local-first, community-driven build of the Codex CLI focused on
open model provider support. It keeps the familiar terminal coding-agent
workflow while adding provider integrations that can be used without changing a
global Codex installation.

The first release feature is native NVIDIA NIM support. More providers and
quality-of-life features will be added from real community requests.

## Community

OpenCodex is meant to be practical and community-shaped. If something breaks,
open an issue. If a provider, model, or workflow is missing, open a feature
request. If the request is clear, useful, and backed by official docs where
needed, it can be added.

Bring the details that make the work actionable:

- What you tried.
- What failed or what you want added.
- Provider/model docs when the request involves an external API.
- Exact model ids, endpoints, and error messages when available.

## Highlights

- Local Codex CLI build that can run side-by-side with a global Codex install.
- Built-in `nvidia-nim` model provider.
- NVIDIA NIM model discovery through the `/v1/models` endpoint.
- NVIDIA NIM chat-completions support through `/v1/chat/completions`.
- Streaming assistant output for NIM chat models.
- Thinking/reasoning display when a NIM model streams `reasoning_content`.
- Provider-specific shell guidance to prefer fast workspace search tools such as
  `rg`, `rg --files`, and `git ls-files`.

Future provider and feature integrations will be driven through GitHub issues.
Open a provider request when you want another model host or API surface added.

## Quick Start

Build the local binary from the Rust workspace:

```powershell
cd codex-rs
$env:CARGO_HOME="$(Resolve-Path ..)\.cargo-local"
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$(Resolve-Path .)\target-local"
cargo build -j 1 -p codex-cli
```

Run the local binary without touching your global Codex data:

```powershell
$env:CODEX_HOME="$(Resolve-Path ..)\.codex-local"
$env:NVIDIA_API_KEY="nvapi-your-key"

& ".\target-local\debug\codex.exe" `
  -c 'model_provider="nvidia-nim"' `
  -c 'model="z-ai/glm-5.1"'
```

On macOS or Linux, use the same config values with your local binary path:

```bash
cd codex-rs
export CODEX_HOME="$(cd .. && pwd)/.codex-local"
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="nvapi-your-key"

./target-local/debug/codex \
  -c 'model_provider="nvidia-nim"' \
  -c 'model="z-ai/glm-5.1"'
```

`model_provider` must be `nvidia-nim`. The model id is the full NIM model slug,
for example `z-ai/glm-5.1`.

## NVIDIA NIM

OpenCodex uses NVIDIA NIM's OpenAI-compatible API shape:

- Model catalog: `GET /v1/models`
- Chat inference: `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer <NVIDIA_API_KEY>`

Default hosted endpoint:

```text
https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
```

Override the endpoint for a self-hosted or private NIM deployment:

```powershell
$env:CODEX_NVIDIA_NIM_BASE_URL="https://your-nim-host.example.com/v1"
```

Detailed setup and troubleshooting are in
[`docs/nvidia-nim.md`](docs/nvidia-nim.md).

## Release Status

This release is provider-focused. NVIDIA NIM is the first supported external
provider. Additional providers, model controls, and provider-specific features
will be added based on community requests and tested integrations.

See [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the current release notes.

## Request a Feature

Use GitHub issues for requests:

- Provider/model request: use the Provider or Model Request issue template.
- Bug report: include `codex --version`, platform, provider, model id, and the
  exact command you ran.
- Feature request: describe the workflow, expected behavior, and links to any
  official API documentation.

Useful details for provider requests:

- Provider name and official API docs.
- Base URL and authentication method.
- Whether the provider supports chat completions, responses, tools, streaming,
  and reasoning/thinking fields.
- Example model ids you want supported.

## Development

Common local commands:

```powershell
cd codex-rs
$env:CARGO_HOME="$(Resolve-Path ..)\.cargo-local"
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$(Resolve-Path .)\target-local"

cargo fmt --package codex-core --package codex-model-provider
cargo check -j 1 -p codex-core -p codex-model-provider
cargo test -j 1 -p codex-model-provider
cargo build -j 1 -p codex-cli
```

Use `-j 1` on machines where parallel Rust builds exhaust memory or pagefile
space.
