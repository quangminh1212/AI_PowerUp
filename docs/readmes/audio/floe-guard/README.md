**A local budget guardrail for AI agents.** It hard-stops your agent *before its
next LLM or paid tool call* when it would cross a spend ceiling — tokens and
tool calls under **one local ceiling**, so a runaway loop dies at $0.10 instead
of $4,000. No account, no signup, no network, **no telemetry**. Runs in your
process.

Works with [CrewAI](#crewai) · [LiteLLM](#litellm) · [LangChain](#langchain) ·
[LangGraph](#langgraph) · [OpenAI](#openai) · [Anthropic](#anthropic) ·
[Gemini](#google-gemini) · [Vercel AI SDK](#vercel-ai-sdk) — and voice pipelines
via [Pipecat](#pipecat-voice) · [LiveKit](#livekit-voice) — or any stack, via
plain `check()` / `record()`. See the [adapter matrix](#adapter-matrix) for what
ships in Python vs TypeScript.
The hard-stop is contract-based: gate each call through the guard — adapters do
it for LLM calls; for paid tools, [`reserve_tool()` / `settle_tool()`](#tool-spend-under-the-same-ceiling)
block *before* the call runs (`record_tool()` alone meters a call after the
fact — it can't stop one already made).

```bash
pip install floe-guard        # Python
npm i floe-guard              # TypeScript (Vercel AI SDK) — see js/
```

```python
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=5.00)   # your ceiling
guard.check()                         # before each LLM call — raises if it'd cross
response = call_your_llm(...)         # your existing call
guard.record("gpt-4o", response.usage.prompt_tokens, response.usage.completion_tokens)
```

When the next call would cross the ceiling, the guard raises `BudgetExceeded` and
prints:

```
BUDGET EXCEEDED — call blocked
  spent so far: $5.001250  |  ceiling: $5.000000
  The next call would cross your budget; floe-guard stopped your agent before it ran.
```

_Run it yourself: `python examples/runaway_loop.py` — no API key, no account, no network._

## See it stop a loop (no API key needed)

```bash
python examples/runaway_loop.py
```

This rigs a loop against a **stub LLM** — no real API key, no account, no network.
It prices each fake `gpt-4o` call offline and the guard halts the loop after a few
iterations. This is the reproducible "stop the loop" demo.

## Why floe-guard?

You can already *see* what your agent spends — the problem is seeing it too late.
floe-guard is the part that **stops the call**, not the part that reports the damage.

- **`max_tokens` / `max_rpm`** cap size and rate, not **dollars** — a cheap model
  stuck in a loop still drains the budget.
- **Usage logs and provider dashboards** tell you what you spent *after* it's gone.
  floe-guard refuses the call *before* it crosses your ceiling.
- **A cost callback that just logs** is notified after the fact and can't halt the
  run — enforcement has to stand in front of the next call. That's where it lives.
- **A hand-rolled `spent += cost` counter races under parallel agents** (CrewAI
  fan-out, `asyncio`, `Promise.all`): N calls read the same under-limit total and
  all fire. floe-guard reserves atomically (`reserve()`/`settle()`), so the ceiling
  holds under concurrency.

The whole job: a hard stop **before** the next call, that **holds under fan-out** —
no account, no network, no crypto.

## How it works

The guard sits **in the call path**, not on an event bus. A passive listener is
told about spend *after the fact* and can't halt anything — so enforcement has to
be the thing standing in front of the next call:

- **`check()`** runs before each LLM call. It predicts the next call's cost from
  the last one and raises `BudgetExceeded` if that would cross your ceiling — the
  call never runs. (A running-total check also catches an overshoot if an estimate
  came in low.)
- **`record(model, prompt_tokens, completion_tokens)`** runs after each response.
  It prices the tokens **offline** from a bundled
  [LiteLLM cost map](src/floe_guard/cost_map.json) and adds the USD to a running
  total.

### Unpriceable models fail closed

If a model isn't in the cost map and you didn't supply a price, the guard **warns
loudly and refuses** (`UnpriceableModelError`) rather than silently treat it as
free — *you can't cap spend you can't measure.* Give it a price to enforce it:

```python
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard, ManualPrice

guard = BudgetGuard(
    limit_usd=5.00,
    price_overrides={"my-self-hosted-model": ManualPrice(1e-6, 2e-6)},  # USD/token
)
# or, set fail_closed=False to warn-and-skip for models you accept un-metered.
```

### What the bundled map prices

The vendored map deliberately covers **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini (AI
Studio), and a curated set of Groq models** (the rules live in
[`scripts/update-cost-map.mjs`](scripts/update-cost-map.mjs)) — not all of
LiteLLM's upstream list. Generic open-weights names (`qwen3-32b`,
`gpt-oss-120b`) are served by many vendors at very different prices, so
resolving them at one vendor's rate would under-meter a spend guard; they stay
unpriceable unless you scope them (`groq/…`) or pass a manual price.

**Gemini is priced at Google AI Studio (Gemini Developer API) rates.** Vertex AI
serves the same model ids at its own — sometimes dearer — rates, and a model id
alone cannot say which billing path a call used, so a Vertex agent should pass
`price_overrides` for the models it uses. Experimental Gemini tiers that Google
lists at $0 stay unpriceable on purpose: a chat model priced at zero would meter
every call as free, which fail-closed pricing cannot catch.

Model ids resolve flexibly: provider-prefixed forms work
(`openai/gpt-4o`, `groq/qwen/qwen3-32b` and the ChatGroq `qwen/qwen3-32b` both
hit the same entry; `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` and the bare `gemini-2.5-flash`
do too), and a dated snapshot the map doesn't list yet
(`claude-opus-4-8-<date>`) prices at its alias entry instead of failing closed.
Everything else — Mistral, Cohere, Ollama, Bedrock, realtime/audio models,
self-hosted — needs `price_overrides` (or `fail_closed=False` to accept it
un-metered).

## Context-aware budgeting

The hard-stop is the guarantee; `advisory()` is the *upside*. Read it before a
step to let your agent **adapt** as it nears the cap — taper to a cheaper model,
shrink the task, or wrap up — instead of getting cut off mid-run.

```python
guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=0.10, near_limit_bps=7000)   # flag at 70% used

adv = guard.advisory()
# BudgetAdvisory(near_limit=False, used_bps=125, remaining_usd=0.0987, ...)
model = "gpt-4o-mini" if adv.near_limit else "gpt-4o"        # downshift near the cap

guard.check()                  # still the hard line — taper or not, this holds
response = call_your_llm(model)
guard.record(model, response.usage.prompt_tokens, response.usage.completion_tokens)
```

`advisory()` returns `near_limit`, `used_bps` (utilization in basis points),
`remaining_usd`, and the budget totals. It also reports `expected_cost` (the
guard's own next-call estimate) and `est_calls_remaining` (how many more calls
the remaining budget buys, `None` until the first call is recorded) — call
headroom, not just dollars. It's a **soft** signal — the model may
ignore it; `check()` is what enforces the ceiling. See
[`examples/budget_aware.py`](examples/budget_aware.py) for a runnable taper demo
(no API key).

### Budget-aware retry

Blind retries can spend the same expensive path again right when the agent is
running out of headroom. `with_budget_retry()` composes over the existing guard:
retry normally while budget is healthy, ask your code for a cheaper retry plan
when `advisory().near_limit` is true, and call `check(estimated_cost)` before
each retry so an over-budget retry never runs.

```python
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard, RetryPlan, with_budget_retry

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)

def premium_model():
    return call_model("gpt-4o")

def mini_model():
    return call_model("gpt-4o-mini")

result = with_budget_retry(
    guard,
    premium_model,
    estimated_cost=0.20,
    max_attempts=2,
    on_degrade=lambda exc, adv: RetryPlan(call=mini_model, estimated_cost=0.01),
)
```

The helper does not rank models or know provider pricing; the caller defines
what "cheaper" means in `on_degrade`. TypeScript exposes the same pattern as
`withBudgetRetry()`. See [`examples/budget_retry.py`](examples/budget_retry.py)
for a no-network demo.

This is the **same advisory shape** hosted Floe returns on every proxied call
(the `X-Floe-Budget-Advisory` header), so the logic you write here ports
unchanged — hosted just answers across *every* vendor and cap with server-truth
balances and rolling-window reset timing, which a single local budget can't know.
The TS package exposes the identical `guard.advisory()`.

## Per-call spend log

The guard keeps a typed, in-memory ledger of everything it priced: each
`record()` / `settle()` appends one `SpendEvent`, and `record_tool()` lets paid
non-LLM calls (search APIs, scrapers) spend the same budget and land in the same
log. The events sum to `spent_usd` (unless a `max_log_events` ring buffer has
evicted old ones) — no more rebuilding per-call breakdowns around the guard.

```python
guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)                      # max_log_events=N caps memory
guard.record("gpt-4o", 1_200, 350, label="researcher")   # label is optional
guard.record_tool("serpapi.search", 0.01, label="researcher")

guard.spend_log      # [SpendEvent(timestamp=…, kind="llm", model_or_tool="gpt-4o",
                     #             prompt_tokens=1200, completion_tokens=350,
                     #             cost_usd=0.0065, label="researcher"), …]
print(guard.export_log(), end="")   # JSONL, one event per line
```

`export_log()` emits a stable snake_case schema —
`{timestamp, kind: llm|tool, model_or_tool, prompt_tokens, completion_tokens,
cost_usd, label?, reserved?}` — identical to the TS package's `exportLog()`, so
every agent produces the same shape regardless of stack and the streams can be
concatenated and analysed together.

## Tool spend under the same ceiling

Tool-heavy agents often spend more on paid APIs (Apollo lookups, Exa searches,
scrapers) than on tokens — and those dollars must count against the same cap,
or the kill-switch guarantee is fiction for them. Tool spend is a first-class
primitive with the full reserve/settle contract; it's actually **stronger**
than the LLM path, because the price is known *before* the call:

```python
# pre-call hard-stop — the crossing call NEVER runs
handle = guard.reserve_tool(0.02)              # raises BudgetExceeded before Apollo
result = apollo.people_lookup(...)
guard.settle_tool("apollo.people_lookup", 0.02, reserved=handle)

guard.record_tool("exa.search", 0.004)         # post-hoc, for metered APIs

guard.tool_costs     # {"apollo.people_lookup": 0.42, "exa.search": 0.11}
guard.remaining_usd  # tokens + tools, one ceiling
```

`record_tool` also updates the next-call estimate, so a plain
`check()`/`record_tool` loop stops *before* the crossing call — a runaway tool
loop dies exactly like a runaway LLM loop. (Tool and LLM estimates are tracked
separately; the default prediction is the costlier of the two, so a cheap tool
call never shrinks the hold ahead of an expensive LLM call.) The caller supplies the USD (there
is no tool cost-map); every tool call lands in `spend_log` as a
`kind: "tool"` event. Same API in TS (`reserveTool`/`settleTool`/`recordTool`/
`toolCosts`). See [`examples/tool_budget.py`](examples/tool_budget.py).

## LatencyBudget — deadlines, the same way

Money isn't the only budget an agent burns. `LatencyBudget` is `BudgetGuard`'s
sibling for **time**: it tracks cumulative elapsed time across a tool chain
against an end-user SLA and stops the *next* call before it would blow it.

```python
from floe_guard import LatencyBudget, DeadlineExceeded

deadline = LatencyBudget(sla_ms=5000)          # the user is promised 5s

for step in plan:
    deadline.check(expected_ms=step.est_ms)    # raises DeadlineExceeded when projected over
    model = DEFAULT_MODEL
    if deadline.advisory().near_deadline:      # 80% consumed by default —
        model = FAST_FALLBACK                  # downshift BEFORE the wall
    run(step, model, timeout_ms=deadline.remaining_ms)
```

Same shape in TypeScript: `new LatencyBudget(5000)`, `check(expectedMs)`,
`remainingMs`, `advisory().nearDeadline`.

Honest scope, mirroring the rest of this package:

- **Monotonic clock** (`time.monotonic()` / `performance.now()`) — NTP steps
  and DST can't corrupt the budget.
- **Cooperative, not preemptive.** The guard supplies the deadline *signal*;
  killing an already-running stalled call is your framework's job (asyncio
  cancellation, `AbortSignal`). `check()` prevents the next call from starting.
- **Advisory symmetry.** `near_deadline` / `used_bps` / `remaining_ms` are the
  latency twin of the budget advisory's `near_limit` / `used_bps` /
  `remaining_usd` — taper logic written against one ports to the other.
- **In-process.** One instance per request/run; distributed/server-side latency
  tracking is out of scope.

## Request-sized estimates and mid-stream enforcement

Two gaps in last-cost prediction, closed in 0.4.0 (Python):

**The oversized first call.** `check()`/`reserve()` predict from the *last*
call — blind on call #1, wrong for a call much bigger than the previous one.
`estimate_call()` prices the **actual incoming request** so even a first call
that alone would cross the cap blocks pre-flight:

```python
est = guard.estimate_call("gpt-4o", prompt_tokens=12_000, max_completion_tokens=4_096)
handle = guard.reserve(est)   # raises BudgetExceeded NOW if this call can't fit
```

The LiteLLM adapter does this automatically (prompt tokens via
`litellm.token_counter`, output cap from `max_tokens`), and the LangChain
handler sizes its pre-call `check()` the same way. Unpriceable or unsized
requests fall back to the old last-cost prediction — the wiring only ever
tightens enforcement.

**The stream that runs long.** `record()` meters a *completed* response — too
late for a generation that starts cheap and keeps going. `guard_stream()` (or
the underlying `StreamGuard`) re-prices the call on every chunk and cuts the
stream off **mid-generation**, settling the tokens actually consumed instead of
recording a big overshoot after the fact:

```python
from floe_guard import guard_stream

for chunk in guard_stream(guard, "gpt-4o", stream, prompt_tokens=1_000):
    print(chunk, end="")   # raises BudgetExceeded mid-stream at the ceiling
```

Chunk sizes are estimated at ~4 chars/token (pass `count_tokens=` for a real
tokenizer); the final accrual reconciles to provider-reported usage via
`StreamGuard.finish(...)`. See
[`examples/streaming_guard.py`](examples/streaming_guard.py) for a runnable
demo (no API key).

## Framework adapters (optional extras)

### CrewAI

```bash
pip install floe-guard[crewai]
```

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.crewai import budget_guarded_llm

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)
llm = budget_guarded_llm(guard, "gpt-4o")   # meters AND hard-stops
Crew(agents=[Agent(..., llm=llm)], tasks=[...]).kickoff()
```

CrewAI runs on LiteLLM, so one callback meters every agent and task under a
single budget. Use `budget_guarded_llm` (not just `guard_crew`) to get the hard
stop: LiteLLM can swallow exceptions raised inside its callbacks (verified on
litellm 1.91.x), so a callback alone may keep the crew running past a
violation. `budget_guarded_llm` also enforces in the LLM call path — where a
raise reliably reaches CrewAI — re-raising any violation the callback recorded
before the next call runs. `guard_crew(guard)` remains available for metering
existing crews; check the returned callback's `tripped` attribute (and the
`floe_guard` logger's ERROR output) if you use it alone. A recorded violation
latches for the life of the callback — after remediating (say, adding a price
override), call `callback.reset()` or build a fresh guard.

### LiteLLM

```bash
pip install floe-guard[litellm]
```

```python
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.litellm import guarded_completion

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)
response = guarded_completion(guard, model="gpt-4o", messages=[...])
```

Prefer the LiteLLM-native callback? Register `budget_guard_callback(guard)` on
`litellm.callbacks` — but know its limit: LiteLLM runs callbacks inside
`except Exception`, so the callback's enforcement raise can be swallowed and
your loop keeps going. The callback records any violation on its `tripped`
attribute and logs it at ERROR level; consult `tripped` in your own loop, or
use `guarded_completion` (which enforces at the call site) for the guaranteed
stop. Wrapper enforcement is tested against litellm 1.91.x.

### LangChain

```bash
pip install floe-guard[langchain] langchain-openai   # langchain-openai only for the ChatOpenAI example below
```

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.langchain import budget_guard_callback_handler

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", callbacks=[budget_guard_callback_handler(guard)])
llm.invoke("hello")            # checks budget before the call, records spend after
```

The handler checks the budget on LLM start (raising `BudgetExceeded` aborts the
call before it runs) and records token usage on LLM end.

### LangGraph

```bash
pip install floe-guard[langgraph]
```

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.langgraph import AdvisoryChannel, guarded_node

class State(TypedDict):
    results: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    budget: AdvisoryChannel          # typed BudgetAdvisory, refreshed per call

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=0.10)

@guarded_node(guard, estimated_cost=0.01)   # reserve() before, settle()/release() after
def worker(state: State) -> dict:
    response = my_llm_call(state)
    return {"results": [response["text"]], "usage": {
        "model": response["model"],
        "prompt_tokens": response["prompt_tokens"],
        "completion_tokens": response["completion_tokens"],
    }}
```

`guarded_node` gives every branch of a `StateGraph` fan-out its own atomic
slice of the ceiling (reserve-before / settle-after, the same contract the
OpenAI and Anthropic adapters use), so N parallel sub-agents can't race one
shared total. Pass `estimated_cost` to hold a conservative fixed slice on
every call of that node (the `0.01` above); a node that omits it estimates
from the guard's last settled cost instead, which is `0` on a fresh guard, so
seed a cold-start fan-out explicitly. After each settled call it writes the guard's `BudgetAdvisory`
into `state["budget"]`, so a router node can downshift to a cheaper model on
`near_limit` *before* the hard-stop — see
[`examples/langgraph_budget_aware.py`](examples/langgraph_budget_aware.py) for
the full budget-aware router (no API key needed).

### OpenAI

```bash
pip install floe-guard[openai]
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.openai import guarded_completion

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)
client = OpenAI()
response = guarded_completion(guard, client, model="gpt-4o", messages=[...])
```

`guarded_completion` reserves the budget before the call (raising
`BudgetExceeded` so a blocked call never reaches OpenAI) and records spend after.
Use `guarded_acompletion` with an `AsyncOpenAI` client for async. See
[`examples/openai_adapter.py`](examples/openai_adapter.py) for a runnable
hard-stop demo (no API key needed).

### Anthropic

```bash
pip install floe-guard[anthropic]
```

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.anthropic import guarded_completion

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)
client = Anthropic()
response = guarded_completion(guard, client, model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", max_tokens=1024, messages=[...])
```

Same reserve-before / record-after contract as the OpenAI adapter; Anthropic's
`input_tokens` / `output_tokens` are mapped onto the guard's prompt/completion
pricing. Use `guarded_acompletion` with an `AsyncAnthropic` client for async.
See [`examples/anthropic_adapter.py`](examples/anthropic_adapter.py) for a
runnable demo of the adapter's native prompt-cache pricing — a cached read
costs a fraction of a fresh one (no API key needed).

### Google Gemini

```bash
pip install 'floe-guard[gemini]'
```

```python
from google import genai
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.gemini import guarded_completion

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)
client = genai.Client(api_key="...")
response = guarded_completion(guard, client, model="gemini-2.5-flash", contents="hello")
```

Same reserve-before / record-after contract as the OpenAI adapter. Gemini splits
usage across five counters and this adapter maps all of them: thinking tokens
(`thoughts_token_count`) and tool-result tokens (`tool_use_prompt_token_count`)
are billed but sit *outside* the obvious prompt/candidates pair, so omitting them
would under-meter; cached tokens are carved out of the prompt count (Gemini
includes them there) and re-priced at the cheaper cache-read rate rather than
charged twice. Use `guarded_acompletion` for async.

**Vertex AI callers must supply prices.** One SDK serves both Google AI Studio
and Vertex with *identical model ids*, but Vertex bills up to 50% more, and the
bundled map carries AI Studio rates — so metering a Vertex call against it would
under-meter. The model id can't reveal the backend, but the client can: the
adapter reads `client.vertexai` and fails closed unless you pass your own rates.

```python
from floe_guard import ManualPrice

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00, price_overrides={
    "gemini-2.5-flash": ManualPrice(3.0e-7, 2.5e-6),   # your Vertex rates
})
```

Streaming isn't wrapped — `generate_content_stream` only reports usage on its
final chunk (or never, if you stop early), so use
[`guard_stream()`](#request-sized-estimates-and-mid-stream-enforcement) to meter
a stream chunk-by-chunk instead.

### Vercel AI SDK

The Vercel AI SDK is TypeScript-only, so it ships as a separate npm package that
lives in [`js/`](js/). It works with both **AI SDK v4 and v5**.

```bash
npm i floe-guard ai @ai-sdk/openai
```

```ts
import { wrapLanguageModel } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { BudgetGuard, budgetGuardMiddleware } from "floe-guard";

const guard = new BudgetGuard(5.0);                   // your ceiling, in USD
const model = wrapLanguageModel({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  middleware: budgetGuardMiddleware(guard),           // throws before crossing
});
```

The middleware `check()`s before each call (throwing `BudgetExceeded` to halt the
run) and `record()`s priced usage after — same semantics as the Python guard. See
[`js/README.md`](js/README.md).

## Voice adapters (STT → LLM → TTS)

A voice pipeline has no single call site to wrap: the LLM sits inside a running
session and turns fire continuously for the life of a call. So instead of a
function wrapper, these adapters enforce **per turn** — reserve before the LLM
call (so a turn is blocked *before* its TTS/audio spend piles on top of a call
that would already cross the ceiling), settle on the real usage the pipeline
reports, and release a turn that ends without ever reporting usage (an
interrupted turn) so the reservation never leaks against the ceiling. The token
cost map is LLM-only, so STT/TTS spend is metered only when you supply per-unit
prices. Both voice adapters are **Python-only** today.

### Pipecat (voice)

```bash
pip install floe-guard[pipecat]
```

Drop a `FloeBudgetGuardProcessor` into the pipeline directly after the LLM
service. It reserves on each turn's `LLMFullResponseStartFrame` and settles from
the `LLMUsageMetricsData` Pipecat emits — so the pipeline's `PipelineTask` must
be created with `enable_metrics=True, enable_usage_metrics=True`.

```python
from pipecat.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline
from pipecat.pipeline.task import PipelineTask, PipelineParams
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard
from floe_guard.integrations.pipecat import FloeBudgetGuardProcessor

guard = BudgetGuard(limit_usd=1.00)

pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),
    stt,
    context_aggregator.user(),
    llm,
    FloeBudgetGuardProcessor(guard, model="gpt-4o"),   # meters AND hard-stops
    tts,
    transport.output(),
    context_aggregator.assistant(),
])
task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(enable_metrics=True, enable_usage_metrics=True),
)
```

> **Fragment** — `transport`, `stt`, `llm`, `tts`, and `context_aggregator` are your existing Pipecat objects; this shows only where the guard sits in a pipeline you already have. For a complete, runnable demo (no API key, no network), see [`examples/voice_turn_budget.py`](examples/voice_turn_budget.py).

By default a blocked turn pushes a fatal `ErrorFrame` that terminates the
pipeline — the hard-stop every other adapter gives you. Pass an
`on_budget_exceeded` async callback to speak a graceful "wrapping up" line first
instead of cutting the call dead.

### LiveKit (voice)

```bash
pip install floe-guard[livekit]
```

`LiveKitBudgetGuard.attach(session, agent)` wires the reserve-before /
settle-after contract onto a LiveKit `AgentSession`: it reserves in the agent's
`llm_node` and settles on the session's `metrics_collected` `LLMMetrics`.
LiveKit's `LLMMetrics` doesn't report the served model, so cost settles against
the `model` you pass here.

```python
from livekit.agents import AgentSession
from floe_guard import BudgetGuard, ManualPrice
from floe_guard.integrations.livekit import LiveKitBudgetGuard

guard = BudgetGuard(
    limit_usd=1.00,
    price_overrides={"gemini-2.0-flash": ManualPrice(0.30e-6, 2.50e-6)},
)
budget = LiveKitBudgetGuard(guard, model="gemini-2.0-flash")

session = AgentSession(...)
budget.attach(session, agent)      # wire reserve / settle / release
await session.start(agent=agent, room=ctx.room)
```

> **Fragment** — `session`, `agent`, and `ctx.room` come from your LiveKit agent entrypoint (`JobContext`); this shows only where the guard attaches.

Pass `stt_usd_per_second` / `tts_usd_per_1k_chars` to also meter STT/TTS spend
(often a voice agent's larger bill) via `record_tool`, and an `on_budget_exceeded`
async callback to speak a wrap-up line before a turn ends. See
[`examples/voice_turn_budget.py`](examples/voice_turn_budget.py).

## Adapter matrix

| Adapter | Python | TypeScript |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | ✅ | via [Vercel AI SDK](#vercel-ai-sdk) |
| Anthropic | ✅ | via [Vercel AI SDK](#vercel-ai-sdk) |
| Google Gemini | ✅ | via [Vercel AI SDK](#vercel-ai-sdk) |
| LangChain | ✅ | — |
| LangGraph | ✅ | — |
| CrewAI | ✅ | — |
| LiteLLM | ✅ | — |
| Vercel AI SDK | — | ✅ |
| **Pipecat** (voice) | ✅ | — |
| **LiveKit** (voice) | ✅ | — |

The TypeScript package is a single Vercel AI SDK middleware that guards any model
the AI SDK wraps (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, …) — it is not a per-framework
adapter set like the Python package.

### TypeScript voice parity

**This release ships no TypeScript voice adapter.** The JS package
([`js/`](js/)) ships one surface — the Vercel AI SDK middleware — and it is
**text-only**: it guards a wrapped `LanguageModel`, not a running STT → LLM → TTS
session. A voice/telephony builder on a Node stack should either drive the LLM
turn through the Vercel AI middleware and meter STT/TTS spend by hand via
`recordTool`, or run the LLM leg through the **hosted [Floe proxy](#upgrade-to-hosted-floe)**
(un-bypassable, cross-vendor) — or use the Python Pipecat / LiveKit adapters
above, which enforce the whole turn. No native TypeScript Pipecat/LiveKit voice
adapter ships in this release.

For wiring floe-guard into an existing voice pipeline, see the Floe docs:
**[Add Floe to your existing pipeline](https://floe-labs.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/integrate-existing-pipeline)**.

## Honest about what this is

floe-guard is a **local, estimate-based** guardrail. It prices tokens from a
vendored cost map *inside your process*:

- The cost map can drift as vendors change prices — refresh it like any snapshot.
- It only sees the vendors you instrument.
- A determined agent or a bug could route around an in-process check.
- Under heavy or cold-start concurrency it bounds steady-state spend, not the
  first parallel wave. Reservations default to the last call's cost (`0` until
  the first `record()`) — size them to the real request with `estimate_call()`
  (the LiteLLM adapter does this for you), or use hosted Floe for a hard cap
  under arbitrary concurrency.
- Mid-stream enforcement (`guard_stream`) prices chunks by a ~4 chars/token
  heuristic unless you supply a tokenizer, so the cut-off point is approximate;
  the final accrual reconciles to provider-reported usage.

It's genuinely useful on its own, and it's honest about its limits. No inflated
metrics, no "zero defaults" claims — it's a free local stop, not a vault.

## No telemetry

floe-guard does **not** phone home. It sends no usage events, no install pings,
no identifiers — nothing leaves your process at runtime except hosted-budget
reads you explicitly opt into by setting `FLOE_API_KEY` (the
[hosted Floe](#upgrade-to-hosted-floe) path) — never otherwise.

This is a choice, not an oversight. A guardrail's whole value is trust: a
library that silently exfiltrates usage from people's agents is the opposite of
a tool you hand a budget to.

## Upgrade to hosted Floe

When you need the ceiling to be **un-bypassable** and **cross-vendor**, hosted
Floe moves enforcement server-side against a real credit line:

- **Un-bypassable** — enforced at the spend rail, not in your process.
- **Cross-vendor** — one budget over LLM tokens *and* paid (x402) tool calls.
- **Team budgets + analytics** — shared ceilings, per-agent isolation, spend history.

Set `FLOE_API_KEY` (your agent key, `floe_<hex>`) and floe-guard can read your
agent's **server-side remaining budget** from the live Floe endpoint:

```python
from floe_guard import hosted_enforcement_available, hosted_remaining_usd

if hosted_enforcement_available():       # True when FLOE_API_KEY is set
    remaining = hosted_remaining_usd()   # USD left, read from Floe's server
```

`hosted_remaining_usd()` GETs `/v1/agents/credit-remaining` and returns the USD
remaining — the minimum of your auto-borrow headroom and your session spend
remaining. It raises `HostedEnforcementError` on a bad/missing key (401), a
closed or suspended agent (403), an unprovisioned agent (404), or a network
failure.

Env vars:

- `FLOE_API_KEY` — your agent key. Required for the read.
- `FLOE_API_BASE_URL` — override the API host (defaults to
  `https://credit-api.floelabs.xyz`).

Honest scope: this call only **reads** the remaining budget. The un-bypassable,
cross-vendor *enforcement* is the hosted Floe product running server-side — not
this client. Use the number to inform a local ceiling; the server stays the
source of truth.
