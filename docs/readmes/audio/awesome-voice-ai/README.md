## Why This List Exists

Voice AI is the fastest-growing segment of the AI stack in 2026. The global Voice Chat API market is projected to reach $3.5B by 2033. Platforms like Retell AI, Vapi, ElevenLabs, and LiveKit are processing billions of minutes monthly. Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise apps will feature AI agents by end of 2026.

But there's no single place to discover all the tools. This list fixes that.
