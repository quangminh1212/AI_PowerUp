**Desktop app for reading Twitch and VK Play chat messages aloud with AI voices**

---

## 📖 Description

StreamTalkerClient is a cross-platform desktop application that reads your Twitch and VK Play Live chat messages aloud using AI-generated voices. It connects to your streaming chat, puts incoming messages in a queue, sends them to a TTS (text-to-speech) server for voice synthesis, and plays the resulting audio through your speakers.

**How it works:** Connect to chat → Messages are queued → AI synthesizes speech → Audio plays

**Supported platforms:**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Linux (X11 desktop environment)

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Download the application

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/VirtualZer0/StreamTalkerClient/releases)
2. Download the archive for your platform:
   - **Windows:** `StreamTalkerClient-win-x64.zip`
   - **Linux:** `StreamTalkerClient-linux-x64.tar.gz`
3. Extract the archive to any folder

### Step 2: Install .NET Runtime

StreamTalkerClient requires the .NET 10 Runtime — a free component from Microsoft that is needed to run the application.

**Windows:**
1. Go to the [.NET 10 Runtime download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)
2. Under **".NET Desktop Runtime"**, click the **x64** installer for Windows
3. Run the downloaded installer
4. Click **Install** → wait for it to finish → click **Close**
5. Restart your computer (recommended)

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dotnet-runtime-10.0
```

**Linux (Fedora):**
```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-runtime-10.0
```

### Step 3: Set up the TTS Server

StreamTalkerClient needs a TTS server to synthesize speech. You have two options:

- **Run the server locally** — Requires an NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM. See the [StreamTalkerServer installation guide](https://github.com/VirtualZer0/StreamTalkerServer#-installation)
- **Connect to a remote server** — If someone else is hosting the server, you just need its URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:7860`)

### Step 4: First launch

1. Run `StreamTalkerClient.exe` (Windows) or `StreamTalkerClient` (Linux)
2. The setup wizard will guide you through:
   - **Server selection** — Choose local Docker server or enter a remote server URL
   - **Docker setup** (local only) — The app checks for Docker/WSL and downloads necessary files
   - **Resource configuration** (local only) — Set GPU memory limits and model options
   - **Health check** — Verifies the TTS server is running and accessible
   - **Voice loading** — Downloads the list of available voices from the server

### Step 5: Connect to chat

1. Select the platform tab (Twitch or VK Play)
2. Enter your channel name
3. Click **Connect**
4. Chat messages will start appearing in the queue and playing as audio!

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>App won't start or crashes on launch</b></summary>

Most likely the .NET 10 Runtime is not installed. Download and install it from the [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) — choose **".NET Desktop Runtime"** for Windows. Restart your computer after installation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can't connect to TTS server</b></summary>

- Make sure the TTS server is running (check `http://localhost:7860/health` in your browser)
- If using a remote server, verify the URL is correct and the server is accessible
- Check your firewall settings — port 7860 must be open
- Try restarting the TTS server
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>No sound playing</b></summary>

- Check your system volume and make sure the correct audio output device is selected
- Check the volume slider in the app (Queue panel)
- Try clearing the cache (Cache panel → Clear) and reconnecting
- On Linux, make sure `aplay` is installed (`sudo apt install alsa-utils`)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hotkeys not working</b></summary>

- Make sure NumLock is enabled (hotkeys use NumPad keys: NumPad5 = skip, NumPad4 = clear)
- On Linux, the app requires X11 for global hotkeys — Wayland is not supported
- Try running the app with elevated permissions if hotkeys still don't work
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Messages not appearing in the queue</b></summary>

- Check that you're connected to the correct channel name
- If `RequireVoice` is enabled in settings, messages must include a voice tag (e.g., `[voice_name] message text`)
- Enable `ReadAllMessages` in settings to process all chat messages regardless of voice tags
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How to change the voice for messages</b></summary>

Two ways to select a voice:
- **Per-message:** Include the voice name in the message using bracket syntax: `[voice_name] Your text here`
- **Per-user binding:** Go to **Manage Voices** → **Bindings** tab, add a username and assign a voice. All messages from that user will use the bound voice.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>High memory usage</b></summary>

The app caches synthesized audio on disk. If disk usage is too high:
- Lower the cache size limit in Settings
- Click **Compress** in the Cache panel to reduce size
- Click **Clear** to delete all cached files
</details>

## Configuration

### First Launch Wizard
On first run, StreamTalkerClient guides you through server setup:

1. **Server Selection** — Choose between local Docker server or remote server
2. **Docker Setup** (local only) — Checks for Docker/WSL, downloads compose files
3. **Resource Configuration** (local only) — Set GPU memory limits and model optimizations
4. **Health Check** — Verifies TTS server connectivity
5. **Voice Loading** — Fetches available voices from the server

### Manual Configuration
Settings are stored in `data/settings.json` and can be edited manually:

```json
{
  "Services": {
    "Twitch": {
      "Channel": "your_channel_name",
      "ReadAllMessages": false,
      "RequireVoice": true
    }
  },
  "Voice": {
    "DefaultVoice": "female_calm",
    "VoiceExtractionMode": "bracket",
    "Speed": 1.0,
    "Temperature": 0.7
  },
  "Server": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:7860",
    "Language": "Russian"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Connecting to Chat
1. Select platform tab (Twitch or VK Play)
2. Enter channel name
3. Click **Connect**
4. Load rewards (optional) to filter by channel point redemptions

### Voice Syntax
Two modes for extracting voice from messages:

**Bracket Mode (default):**
```
[voice_name] Text to synthesize
```

**First-Word Mode:**
```
voice_name Text to synthesize
```

### Voice Bindings
Assign specific voices to users:

### Key Architectural Layers
- **Views** — Thin AXAML shells that bind to ViewModels (no business logic)
- **ViewModels** — Orchestration layer (MainWindowViewModel owns all services/managers)
- **Services** — External I/O (streaming platforms, TTS server, audio playback)
- **Managers** — Core business logic (queueing, synthesis, playback, cache)
- **Models** — Data structures and settings schema
