## What it is

**Dub Studio** turns any video into a dubbed version in another language — **with the speaker's own voice cloned, captions translated, and on‑screen text localized right on the frame**. Drop a clip, and a smart auto‑pass builds the first draft; then a live editor puts **every caption, voice, blur box, font and title** under your control with an instant preview.

By default everything runs **locally on your machine** — no cloud, no subscription; your footage and your voiceprint never leave your computer. And if your PC is weak (can't run the local Gemma/Higgs) or you want more speed and quality, the heavy stages (translation, vision, TTS, transcription) can **optionally** be offloaded to the cloud via **OpenRouter** — each engine picked independently (local ↔ cloud), with voices auto-cast by speaker gender (beta). The key is stored locally; everything is off by default.

It's a **fully native rewrite**. No embeddable Python, no torch, no CUDA wheels. The whole pipeline is **Rust + native C++/CUDA engines (GGUF/ONNX)**: one process, fast startup, low VRAM. Models, engines, CUDA/VC++ runtime and ffmpeg are **downloaded and installed by the app itself** on first run. **NVIDIA is recommended but not required** — separation ships a CPU build, diarization and ASR run on CPU, and the heavy stages (translation, vision, TTS) go to the cloud, so a dub can be built on a machine with no NVIDIA at all.

## Five modes, switchable on the fly

| Mode | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| 🎙️ **Dub** | Full re-voice into the target language with the **original timbre cloned** — auto-cast per speaker or pick a voice |
| 🗣️ **Voice-over** | Translated voice **over the ducked original** — the source is still audible underneath; balance is adjustable |
| 📝 **Subtitles** | Burn **original-language** captions, keep the original audio — no dubbing, no translation |
| ✨ **Funny remix** | Give a theme ("as a pirate", "as a news report") → the model **rewrites the whole script**, then re-dubs |
| 🎬 **Transcript** | Clean **diarized transcript** with per-speaker layout, karaoke play-along, one-click voice creation, `.srt`/`.txt` export |

Load a clip once and send it into any mode — right inside the editor.

## Features

- **Voice cloning** — the original timbre is cloned and speaks the new language (native [Higgs Audio v3](https://huggingface.co/bosonai) engine, GGUF). Auto-cast by speaker or bring your own voice from a pack.
- **Speaker diarization** — who speaks and when (NVIDIA **Sortformer** v2, up to 4 voices), a distinct voice per speaker.
- **Character casting (beta)** — a character is a **face + voice** pair. The app gathers faces across the whole video, recognizes the same person and **binds them to a speaker by co-occurrence** (the one on camera in close-up gets the voice, a background listener doesn't); it auto-picks the clearest avatar frame and **saves a casting profile for the whole series** — assign voices and character descriptions once, and the **next episode applies them automatically**. A **real-faces / cartoon·anime** toggle switches the face detection accordingly.
- **Choice of ASR engine** — transcribe with **Parakeet-TDT** (GPU, default) or **Whisper** ([Purfview faster-whisper standalone](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win), runs on CPU) — pick the model size (tiny … large-v3-turbo) and quant (compute type) right in settings.
- **Import ready-made subtitles** — bring your own `.srt`/`.ass` as the exact transcript: text and timing come straight from the file instead of auto-recognition (speakers are still auto-assigned by diarization). Tick **“subtitles already in the target language”** and translation is skipped too — an English clip + your Russian subs → a Russian dub straight from them, no ASR and no MT.
- **Multi-language export** — the **▾** next to Export sends one video into several languages at once; each inherits all your edits (subtitle layout, styles, blur boxes, cloned voice) — only the text is re-translated and re-voiced.
- **Save & reopen projects** — autosave, a list of recent projects on the start screen, and jump back into unfinished work in one click.
- **Searchable voice & language pickers** — type part of a name to filter hundreds of voices or 100+ languages; languages also match by their name in your UI language.
- **Composable pipeline** — independent toggles at the input: audio (original / dub / voiceover / transcript) × subtitles (none / original / translated) × burn-in on/off × funny remix. Any combination — dub without subtitles, translated subtitles without dubbing, funny dub with your own voices — in batch and in the editor too.
- **On-screen text localization** — OCR detects baked-in text (**PP-OCR** ONNX), **blurs the original** and prints a localized title on top in a matched style — a feature no other tool has.
- **Translation + vision style analysis** — the transcript is translated locally with **Gemma-4 12B** (GGUF, llama.cpp); a vision pass reads the frame layout: caption style, titles, brands, text zones.
- **SOTA vocal separation** — **Mel-Band Roformer** (native BSRoformer.cpp on CUDA) splits voice from music, so the backing track is **preserved** and the clone latches onto clean speech.
- **26 caption presets** — karaoke / word-by-word / hormozi / neon and more, rendered **on your own frame** (WYSIWYG, JASSUB over the same `.ass` that ffmpeg burns).
- **Karaoke transcript** — play the video and follow along as the current line and the current **word** light up in the transcript.
- **Live editor** — edit transcript, voices, caption style, blur boxes, titles; **~0.17 s/frame preview**, every change visible instantly.
- **Smart re-gen** — export re-synthesizes and recomputes **only the segments you changed**, not the whole clip.
- **Add your own lines** — insert custom phrases into the transcript; each is voiced in the speaker's cloned voice and shown in the subtitles.
- **Batch processing** — a queue of files, all run with one setup, per-file progress.
- **Before/after compare** — original and dub side by side.
- **100+ languages** — dub into any major language (Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi and more), with source-language auto-detect.
- **Any video format** — MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM, AVI and more (decoded via ffmpeg).
- **One-button setup + resumable downloads + in-app auto-update** — models, engines, CUDA/VC++ runtime and ffmpeg download on first run; large models (10 GB+) **resume from where they stopped** after a dropped connection instead of restarting; the app updates itself.
- **Run each stage where you want** — separation, diarization and ASR each switch independently between **GPU, CPU, and cloud**; combine them however you like. With the heavy models (translation, vision, TTS) offloadable to **OpenRouter**, the whole pipeline runs even on a machine with **no NVIDIA**.
- **Tune for your hardware** — every engine ships multiple quants (TTS Q8/Q6/Q4, translation Q4…Q8, ASR int8/fp32 or Whisper tiny…large-v3-turbo, separation Q8/Q5/Q4) — switch in settings; cap the **prefill batch** and **voice-reference length** to fit 8–12 GB GPUs and 32 GB RAM.
- **Fully portable** — nothing is written to your user profile; delete the folder and no trace remains.

## Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10 / 11 (x64)
- **GPU:** NVIDIA with 8–16 GB VRAM recommended — **or none**: separation, diarization and ASR run on CPU, and the heavy models go to the cloud
- **WebView2** — preinstalled on Windows 11 (installs automatically on Windows 10)
- **Disk:** ~15 GB for models, engines and runtime (fetched on first run), plus room for your projects

On an NVIDIA machine the only thing you install by hand is a recent **[NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**. Everything else — models (Higgs Audio v3, Gemma-4 12B + vision, Parakeet-TDT, Sortformer, Mel-Band Roformer), engines, CUDA runtime and ffmpeg — the app downloads with a button on first run.

## Quick start

1. **Download** the portable build from [Releases](https://github.com/timoncool/dub-studio/releases) and unzip anywhere (or install via `-setup.exe` / `.msi`).
2. **Run** `Dub Studio.exe`.
3. On the **First-run** panel press **Download all** — the app fetches models, engines and runtime (~15 GB, once). If the NVIDIA driver is missing, the button opens the download page.
4. **Drop a video**, pick a target language → the auto-pass makes the first draft. Fine-tune everything in the editor and hit **Export**.

> Everything downloads and lives **inside the app folder**. Models, caches and projects go nowhere else.

## How it works

`analyze()` is a fixed first pass: separation → ASR with word timings → diarization → context translation + vision (caption style / titles / brands) → OCR (layout / blur boxes). The result is an editable **Project** document. Each edit is a patch on that Project with a ~0.17 s/frame preview; export re-runs **only the dirtied stages**.

**Stack:** a native **Tauri 2 (Rust)** shell spawns `dub-server` (axum) on a local port and opens a window onto the SPA — React 19 + Vite + Tailwind + react-konva over JASSUB. Engines: Parakeet-TDT or Whisper (ASR) · Sortformer (diarization) · Gemma-4-12B GGUF (translation + vision, llama.cpp) · Higgs Audio v3 (TTS) · Mel-Band Roformer (separation, BSRoformer.cpp) · PP-OCR (ONNX) · ffmpeg/NVENC. **Not a single Python process at runtime.**

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timoncool/dub-studio.git
cd dub-studio

cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..   # 1) SPA
cargo build --release -p dub-server                     # 2) native server (axum)
cd desktop && npm install && npx tauri build            # 3) desktop shell (Tauri)
```

Needs Node 20+, Rust (MSVC toolchain) and WebView2. Native engines (`audiocpp_engine.dll`, llama.cpp, BSRoformer.cpp, ONNX Runtime) don't need rebuilding — the app downloads prebuilt binaries.

## Contributing & forks

**Collaborators are very welcome.** I'd be genuinely happy to see Dub Studio forked to other platforms and GPUs — the architecture is capable of it, I simply don't have the bandwidth to do the ports myself. If you want it on **AMD / Intel GPUs, macOS or Linux**, fork it and go — PRs welcome.

**Extra localizations** are just as welcome: the app and landing ship in 6 languages today — translate the locale files (`frontend/src/locales/` and the dict in `docs/index.html`) and open a PR to add yours.
