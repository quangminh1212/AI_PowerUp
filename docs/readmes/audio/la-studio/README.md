## Project Updates

### 2026-07-23 - Version 0.2.0: Video Dubbing

LA Studio version 0.2.0 introduces **Video Dubbing**, an end-to-end local workflow for translating and replacing speech in audio or video. Import media, separate vocals from background audio, transcribe and translate timestamped segments, synthesize the translated dialogue with local voices, review or edit each segment, then mix and export the dubbed result. Automatic and step-by-step workflows keep every stage visible and configurable, while media processing and AI inference remain offline on the user's machine.

### 2026-07-16 - Version 0.1.10: Translation Studio

LA Studio version 0.1.10 introduces **Translation Studio**, a fully local workspace for translating plain text and subtitle files. Import text, SRT, or VTT content; translate an entire project or individual segments; review and edit source and target text side by side; save project history; and export results as text, SRT, VTT, or JSON. The initial model lineup includes M2M-100 and MADLAD-400 through the CrispASR runtime, plus Tencent Hy-MT2 1.8B through llama.cpp, with all translation inference running offline on the user's machine.

### 2026-07-14 - Version 0.1.9: Voice Isolator Support

LA Studio version 0.1.9 begins support for **Voice Isolator**, a local source-separation workflow for extracting vocal and background stems from audio or video files. The new studio supports sherpa-onnx separation models, including UVR-MDX-NET Vocals and Spleeter two-stem models, with progress reporting, waveform previews, playback, and stem export. Processing remains fully offline on the user's machine.

### 2026-07-10 - Version 0.1.8: VieNeu-TTS v3 Upstream Update

LA Studio version 0.1.8 updates **[VieNeu-TTS-v3-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/pnnbao-ump/VieNeu-TTS-v3-Turbo)** support to follow the latest changes from the original author, including updated reference/denoise options and improved native runtime integration. This release also improves TTS cancellation, audio playback controls, model setup guidance, and backend thread management.

### 2026-07-03 - Version 0.1.7: Kokoro Vietnamese Support

LA Studio version 0.1.7 now supports Vietnamese text-to-speech using the fine-tuned Kokoro-82M model. Special thanks to the author **iamdinhthuan** for the original **[Kokoro-Vietnamese](https://github.com/iamdinhthuan/Kokoro-Vietnamese)** repository and model training.

### 2026-07-01 - VieNeu-TTS-v3-Turbo Support

LA Studio now supports **[VieNeu-TTS-v3-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/pnnbao-ump/VieNeu-TTS-v3-Turbo)**, a high-fidelity 48 kHz Vietnamese-English text-to-speech model by Pham Nguyen Ngoc Bao. Integrated via the native `VieNeu-TTS.cpp` runtime, it offers hardware acceleration (CPU, CUDA, Vulkan) and real-time progress tracking. The entire pipeline runs completely offline on your hardware to ensure data privacy.

### 2026-06-23 - Nemotron-3.5 Streaming ASR

LA Studio now supports NVIDIA **Nemotron-3.5 ASR Streaming 0.6B** for local multilingual speech-to-text through CrispASR. The Model Gallery can download the Q4_K or F16 GGUF model and compatible CrispASR v0.8.4 CPU, CUDA, or Vulkan runtime packages.

## Overview

LA Studio, short for Local Audio Studio, is an offline AI audio workstation for creators, developers, researchers, and teams that need local speech AI without sending audio files, prompts, or generated voices to cloud APIs.

The app brings together local speech-to-text, text-to-speech, voice cloning, voice design, text and subtitle translation, model discovery, Hugging Face downloads, runtime installation, hardware checks, and audio preview tools behind a modern desktop interface. It is built with C++17, Qt 6/QML, CMake, and native AI runtime adapters for fast local inference.

## Use Cases

- Run private speech transcription locally for interviews, meetings, research recordings, podcasts, and voice notes.
- Generate local voiceovers for video, learning content, prototypes, narration, and accessibility workflows.
- Dub videos locally by translating dialogue, generating replacement speech, preserving background audio, and exporting the finished media.
- Translate scripts and subtitles locally, review bilingual segments, and export results without sending content to a cloud service.
- Test multiple open speech and audio models from a single desktop interface.
- Build and validate model catalogs, runtime packages, and Hugging Face download flows.
- Experiment with voice cloning and voice design without relying on external inference APIs.
- Develop C++/Qt integrations for local AI audio workflows.

## How LA Studio Works

    A["Browse curated audio models"] --> B["Download model files and runtime packages"]
    B --> C["Validate local files and hardware compatibility"]
    C --> D["Run STT, TTS, voice, or translation workflows locally"]
    D --> E["Preview audio, review history, and manage settings"]
```

1. Open the model gallery and choose an STT, TTS, voice cloning, voice design, or translation model family.
2. Download the required model files and runtime package from the app.
3. LA Studio validates local files, runtime compatibility, and available hardware acceleration.
4. Use the studio pages to transcribe audio, generate speech, clone or design voices, or translate text and subtitles offline.

## Supported Models and Runtimes

LA Studio is catalog-driven, so supported models can evolve without rewriting the core UI. Current catalog families include:

| Category | Example model families |
| --- | --- |
| Speech-to-Text | Whisper, Qwen3-ASR 0.6B, Qwen3-ASR 1.7B |
| Text-to-Speech | Kokoro 82M, VibeVoice Realtime, VieNeu-TTS v2 Turbo, VieNeu-TTS v3 Turbo, Qwen3-TTS |
| Voice Cloning | VoxCPM2, OmniVoice, Qwen3 custom voice packages |
| Voice Design | VoxCPM2 voice design, Qwen3 voice design packages |
| Translation | M2M-100 418M, MADLAD-400 3B, Tencent Hy-MT2 1.8B |

Runtime support is handled through native adapters and dynamic libraries. Depending on model availability and platform support, LA Studio can use CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, and other runtime-specific acceleration paths.

## Build From Source

The primary development path is Windows with MSVC 2022, Qt 6, CMake, Ninja, and vcpkg.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools with the MSVC x64 toolchain
- Qt 6.5+ with the `msvc2022_64` kit
- CMake 3.21+
- Ninja
- Git

### Quick Start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dduongtrandai/LA-Studio.git
cd LA-Studio
.\scripts\bootstrap.bat
```

After a successful release build, run:

```powershell
.\out\build\windows-msvc-release\LA Studio.exe
```

For a faster development build that skips deployment:

```powershell
.\scripts\bootstrap.bat -SkipDeploy
```

For an explicit Qt path:

```powershell
.\scripts\bootstrap.bat -QtRoot C:\Qt\6.9.3
```

For detailed setup, troubleshooting, and preset notes, see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).

## Testing

Run the test script from the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_tests.bat
```

The `tests/` directory includes focused coverage for model path migration, model and runtime flows, download/install behavior, audio preview behavior, file access, history, and STT session logic.

## Architecture

LA Studio uses a QML front end with C++ controllers and core managers. The app keeps model catalog logic, downloads, runtime discovery, hardware checks, audio services, and studio actions behind clear C++ service boundaries.

```text
QML UI
  |
  | Qt properties, signals, and slots
  v
AppController and studio controllers
  |
  | Session state, user actions, model selection
  v
Core services and managers
  |
  | Catalogs, downloads, settings, registry, hardware, logging
  v
Audio services and AI runtimes
  |
  | STT, TTS, voice cloning, voice design backends
  v
Local model files and runtime libraries
```

Key source areas:

- `src/controllers/` bridges QML screens to application services; files are grouped under `app/`, feature, `models/`, and `shared/` boundaries.
- `src/dubbing/` owns dubbing project/media logic and dubbing-specific workflow definitions; the reusable workflow engine remains in `src/workflows/`.
- `src/alignment/` owns alignment-specific domain and workflow resolution logic, while QML-facing alignment adapters remain in `src/controllers/alignment/`.
- `src/core/` manages catalogs, models, downloads, settings, runtimes, registry, hardware, and logging.
- `src/audio/` provides recording, playback, WAV handling, and waveform support.
- `src/stt/` contains speech-to-text engine and backend selection.
- `src/tts/` contains text-to-speech engine, validation, workers, and backend selection.

## Privacy and Offline Operation

LA Studio is designed for local inference. Audio recordings, prompts, generated speech, transcriptions, model selections, and runtime activity stay on the local machine unless the user explicitly downloads model files or runtime packages from external sources.
