## 📋 Requirements

- [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
- [ComfyUI-Qwen-TTS](https://github.com/flybirdxx/ComfyUI-Qwen-TTS) (base package)
- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended) or CPU

**Hardware Compatibility**: Works on any system that can run Qwen3-TTS (NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs with ROCm, Mac M1/M2, CPU)

## 🚀 Installation

### Method 1: ComfyUI Manager (Recommended - Coming Soon)
1. Open ComfyUI Manager
2. Search for "Qwen3-TTS Emotional"
3. Click Install
4. Restart ComfyUI

### Method 2: Manual Installation

**Step 1**: Install the base Qwen3-TTS package first
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/flybirdxx/ComfyUI-Qwen-TTS.git
cd ComfyUI-Qwen-TTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2**: Add the Emotional Voice Clone node
```bash
# Download qwen3_emotional_clone.py from this repo
# Place it in: ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Qwen-TTS/
```

**Step 3**: Update `__init__.py`

Add these lines to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Qwen-TTS/__init__.py`:

```python
# Import emotional clone nodes
try:
    from .qwen3_emotional_clone import (
        NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS as EMOTIONAL_MAPPINGS,
        NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS as EMOTIONAL_DISPLAY
    )
    EMOTIONAL_LOADED = True
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️ Failed to load emotional clone nodes: {e}")
    EMOTIONAL_LOADED = False

# Add to the existing NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS section
if EMOTIONAL_LOADED:
    NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS.update(EMOTIONAL_MAPPINGS)
    NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS.update(EMOTIONAL_DISPLAY)
    print("✅ Emotional Voice Clone node loaded!")
```

**Step 4**: Restart ComfyUI

## 💡 Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Add the node**: Right-click → `Qwen3-TTS` → `🎭 Qwen3-TTS Emotional Voice Clone (Ultimate)`
2. **Connect reference audio**: Load your voice sample (5-30 seconds recommended)
3. **Enter text**: What you want the voice to say
4. **Select emotion**: Choose from 80+ presets
5. **Generate**: Queue the prompt

### Single Emotion Example
```
Primary Emotion: sad
Secondary Emotion: none
Tertiary Emotion: none
Intensity: 1.0x
Result: Pure sad delivery
```

### Multi-Emotion Mixing Examples

**Bitter (Pre-mixed)**
```
Primary: sad
Secondary: angry
Intensity: 1.0x
= Bitter, resentful tone
```

**Manic Energy**
```
Primary: excited
Secondary: nervous  
Tertiary: breathless
Intensity: 1.5x
= Frantic, overwhelming energy
```

**Maximum Confidence**
```
Primary: confident
Secondary: arrogant
Tertiary: dismissive
Intensity: 2.0x
= Peak smugness and authority
```

**Defeated Character**
```
Primary: defeated
Secondary: apologetic
Tertiary: whispering
Intensity: 1.2x
= Complete emotional breakdown
```

### Advanced Settings

**Fast Generation** (3-5 seconds):
- `x_vector_only`: True (enabled)
- `ref_audio_transcript`: Leave empty
- Good for testing, quick iterations

**High Quality** (15-20 seconds):
- `x_vector_only`: False (disabled)
- `ref_audio_transcript`: Fill in what the reference audio says
- Better voice matching, complete sentences

**Controlling Length**:
- Use **randomize seed** to try different generation lengths
- When you get a good long generation, note the seed
- Use that **fixed seed** for consistent results

## 🎨 Emotion Mixing Tips

### Energy Combinations
- `calm + confident = assured`
- `excited + happy = ecstatic`
- `tired + defeated = hopeless`

### Social Dynamics
- `confident + mocking = smug`
- `nervous + apologetic = submissive`
- `angry + contemptuous = hateful`

### Physical + Emotional
- `breathless + excited = exhilarated`
- `drunk + happy = jolly`
- `whispering + fearful = terrified`

### Character Voices
- **Confident Scientist**: `confident + condescending + dismissive`
- **Nervous Assistant**: `nervous + insecure + apologetic`
- **Anxious Student**: `anxious + overwhelmed + stressed`

## 📊 Parameter Guide

### Emotion Intensity
- **0.0x**: Neutral (no emotion)
- **0.5x**: Subtle hint
- **1.0x**: Normal strength (default)
- **1.5x**: Strong emotion
- **2.0x**: Extreme/exaggerated

### How It Works
The node adjusts three generation parameters based on emotion:
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness/variation
- **Repetition Penalty**: Affects word repetition and flow  
- **Top-p**: Nucleus sampling probability

Emotions are mixed by averaging their parameter adjustments, then multiplied by intensity.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Audio cuts off abruptly
- This is seed-dependent behavior
- Try randomizing seed multiple times
- Use longer input text
- Consider using `x_vector_only=False` with transcript

### Generation too fast (3 seconds)
- This is normal for `x_vector_only=True` mode
- For longer, more accurate generation:
  - Set `x_vector_only=False`
  - Fill in `ref_audio_transcript`
  - Should take 15-20 seconds

### Voice doesn't match reference
- Make sure reference audio is clear (5-30 seconds)
- Try `x_vector_only=False` with accurate transcript
- Use higher quality reference audio (24kHz recommended)

### Node doesn't appear
- Verify base ComfyUI-Qwen-TTS is installed
- Check `__init__.py` was updated correctly
- Look for errors in ComfyUI console
- Try restarting ComfyUI
