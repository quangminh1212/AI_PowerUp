## The Missing Feedback Loop

Getting an agent to talk is easy. Making it reliable is the hard part.

A bad conversation happens. Someone reviews it manually. A prompt gets tweaked. But no reusable test is created, no eval is added, and the same failure comes back later in a slightly different form.

The missing layer is the feedback loop around the runtime: business tool access, policy enforcement, session history, QA workflows, evals, provisioning, and deployment.

ModelGuide gives you that layer as open source — so you can turn failures into tests, tests into better instructions, and ship voice agents on any stack without rebuilding production infrastructure from scratch. Start with voice. Extend to other customer-facing channels when needed.

## What ModelGuide Is

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/811f1756-4948-461e-abdd-7691ee3d9ccc
" controls width="100%"></video>

ModelGuide sits between your agent runtime and your business systems. It is not a voice runtime and it is not a hosted black box. It is the orchestration layer you own.

- Connect business systems once over [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- Assign the right tools to each agent with confirmation gates and secure credentials
- Compile SOPs and guardrails into agent behavior
- Record sessions with transcripts, tool traces, CSAT, and QA tags
- Run evals and simulations against real workflows
- Provision new organizations from repeatable YAML blueprints

## Why Builders Use ModelGuide

| Builder need | What ModelGuide gives you |
|---|---|
| **Closed feedback loop** | Run simulations and evals, turn failed conversations into reusable test cases and evaluators, and recompile better instructions |
| **Less production glue code** | Connect tools, sessions, SOPs, evals, and operator workflows without rebuilding the harness around every runtime |
| **Runtime portability** | Keep LiveKit, Pipecat, ElevenLabs, Mastra, or your own runtime. The business layer stays portable. |
| **One place for agent context** | Manage tools, SOPs, guardrails, confirmation policies, and review workflows from a single control layer |
| **Reviewable behavior** | Full session records, tool traces, CSAT, QA tags, and eval results — complements your observability stack |
| **Self-hostable production infrastructure** | Open-source, self-hostable, with multi-tenant auth, encrypted secrets, and row-level security |

ModelGuide focuses on agent behavior and review: transcripts, tool traces, CSAT, QA tags, SOP adherence, and eval results. Keep Langfuse, Datadog, Honeycomb, or OpenTelemetry for lower-level runtime telemetry and infrastructure tracing.

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Docker 24+, Bun 1.1+, Node 22+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelguide/modelguide.git
cd modelguide
make quickstart
```

Then in separate terminals:

```bash
make api-dev    # API at http://localhost:3000
make ui-dev     # Dashboard at http://localhost:3001
```

Open `http://localhost:3001`. The seed creates three industry-vertical organizations — retail, medical call center, B2B industrial — each with Medusa e-commerce and Zendesk helpdesk connectors, two agents, and ~300 realistic sessions. Log in with `delivered+admin-glowbox@resend.dev` (magic link printed to API console).

Full vertical matrix, dev accounts, and session scenarios: [`docs/guide/seed-data.md`](docs/guide/seed-data.md).

## How Teams Use ModelGuide

**1. Define what your agent should do.** Describe the persona, connect your business systems, set the rules and guardrails. ModelGuide keeps that operational context in one place.

**2. Generate the instructions your runtime uses.** ModelGuide compiles that context into agent instructions and exposes the approved business tools over MCP.

**3. Generate test assets automatically.** ModelGuide creates synthetic conversations, eval suites, evaluators, and QA workflows to test the agent before it reaches production traffic.

**4. Run the feedback loop.** ModelGuide runs simulations, scores behavior, and gives your team transcripts, tool traces, CSAT, QA tags, and eval results to review.

**5. Tighten the operating context.** Use failures to update SOPs, guardrails, persona, tools, and compiled instructions until the automated checks consistently look right.

**6. Validate manually before launch.** Once the agent passes the automated checks, run manual tests in your runtime and confirm the experience is good enough to ship.

The closed feedback loop is already here: define the context, compile the instructions, generate tests, run simulations, score behavior, and improve the agent from failures. Over time, more of the prompt and context fixes can be automated.

## Reference Implementations

The reference implementations prove that the orchestration layer stays portable across runtimes and channels.

Start with the LiveKit implementation for the fastest end-to-end path. Use the Pipecat or ElevenLabs examples if your team already runs there. The Mastra example shows the same orchestration layer extending beyond voice when you need another customer-facing channel.

| Runtime | Why it exists | Path |
|---|---|---|
| **LiveKit Agents** *(flagship)* | Fastest path to a production voice agent with telephony, MCP tool wiring, session tracking, eval tests, and deployment docs | [`examples/agents/livekit-agent/`](examples/agents/livekit-agent/) |
| **Pipecat** | Same orchestration model for teams already committed to Pipecat | [`examples/agents/pipecat-agent/`](examples/agents/pipecat-agent/) |
| **ElevenLabs Conversational AI** | Manage platform agent config, tools, and prompts from version-controlled local definitions | [`examples/agents/elevenlabs-agent/`](examples/agents/elevenlabs-agent/) |
| **Mastra** | Email "Where Is My Order?" example showing the orchestration layer extends beyond voice when you need another customer-facing channel | [`examples/agents/mastra-wismo-email-agent/`](examples/agents/mastra-wismo-email-agent/) |

## Provisioning an Organization

The `mg` CLI provisions a new organization from a directory of YAML files — users, connectors, agents with compiled instructions, SOPs, guardrails, and demo sessions — in one command. Safe to re-run against the same directory.

```bash
bun run src/cli/mg.ts setup /path/to/my-org/
```

Full flag reference, per-command usage, and Railway instructions: [`docs/guide/cli.md`](docs/guide/cli.md).

## Roadmap

🚧 **Sub-agents & Workflow Builder** — Compose multi-step agent workflows with branching and handoffs

🚧 **OTEL + A/B Testing via Langfuse** — OpenTelemetry traces, prompt variant experiments, side-by-side comparison

🚧 **Agentic Insights** — Custom funnels tracking agent behavior through business-defined conversion paths

🚧 **Closed-loop instruction tuning** — turn repeated eval and simulation failures into suggested SOP, guardrail, and instruction fixes

📋 **More Blueprints** — Contact center ships first; healthcare intake, field service, B2B sales next

📋 **Connector Marketplace** — Community-built integrations

## Deployment

Docker Compose for local and staging (`make docker-up`), Railway for production. The Railway architecture is PostgreSQL + API + UI + Caddy load balancer (the LB is the only public-facing service, routing `/api/*` and `/mcp` to the API and everything else to the UI over Railway's internal network). Config is as-code via `railway.toml` per service — full setup and deploy steps in [`railway/DEPLOY.md`](railway/DEPLOY.md).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| API | [Hono](https://hono.dev) + [Bun.js](https://bun.sh) |
| Agent Protocol | [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 + [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) |
| Dashboard | [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) + React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Auth | JWT + magic links (users) · API keys (agents) |
| API Docs | [Scalar](https://scalar.com) (auto-generated from OpenAPI) |

No proprietary components. Every layer is inspectable, replaceable, forkable.

Production foundations include RBAC with separate admin/support/agent auth paths, encrypted secrets, row-level security, and a full CI pipeline running lint, typecheck, unit, integration, and MCP-protocol tests on every PR. See [ADR-005](docs/decisions/005-sops-as-core-primitive.md) for the SOP primitive, [ADR-007](docs/decisions/007-evaluation-engine.md) and [ADR-009](docs/decisions/009-eval-suites.md) for the evals engine.
