A Discord voice-channel conversational bot with a [Textual TUI](https://textual.textualize.io/). The bot joins voice channels, listens to speakers, transcribes speech in real time, maintains multi-turn conversations using [Google GenAI](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai), and replies with synthesized speech via [ElevenLabs](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python).

---

## Features

- **Voice integration**: Joins Discord voice channels via [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [discord-ext-voice-recv](https://github.com/imayhaveborkedit/discord-ext-voice-recv) with DAVE encryption support
- **Real-time transcription**: Per-user speech-to-text via [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text](https://github.com/googleapis/python-speech)
- **Conversational AI**: Multi-turn chat with [Google GenAI](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai) and conversation context
- **Text-to-speech**: [ElevenLabs](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python) streaming TTS
- **Smart reply triggers**:
  - Default: reply after a silence window (configurable), with a cooldown between replies
  - Mention mode: wait for silence after the bot name is mentioned, within a configurable window
  - Join greeting: optional spoken greeting when the bot joins or others enter mid-session
- **[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)**: Session control from the terminal; **privacy**: users must run `/consent accept` on discord before their voice is transcribed or sent to third-party APIs (see slash commands `/consent`, `/data`)
- **Characters**: System instructions, Gemini model, and ElevenLabs voice per character
- **Session logging**: JSON transcripts and usage counters per session

## Installation

### Windows

Tagged releases publish **Windows** artifacts on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Magnus5405/discord-audio-bot/releases):

| Asset | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **`DiscordAudioBotTUI-Setup.exe`** | Inno Setup installer — installs under Program Files, adds a Start Menu entry, and optionally a desktop shortcut. |
| **`DiscordAudioBotTUI-windows.zip`** | Portable folder — extract anywhere and run `DiscordAudioBotTUI.exe`. |

Both bundles include **FFmpeg** next to the executable — no separate FFmpeg install. The build ships a read-only `settings-example.json` beside the app; the real `settings.json` is created only when you save from the **Settings** TUI editor, so upgrades in the same folder preserve your existing config.

### MacOS / Linux
No official releases for macOS and Linux, but contributions are welcome to implement this.

Install and run **from source**; follow [Development](#development).


### API credentials

You need accounts for **Discord**, **Google** (Gemini + Speech-to-Text), and **ElevenLabs**:

- **Discord**: [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) $\rightarrow$ `DISCORD_TOKEN`.
- **Gemini**: API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) $\rightarrow$ `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Speech-to-Text**: [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) credentials for Speech-to-Text API enabled $\rightarrow$ `GOOGLE_STT_API_KEY` for v1, or service account + project fields for v2.
- **ElevenLabs**: [API keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys) $\rightarrow$ `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/magnus5405/discord-audio-bot/wiki) for a more detailed description on how to aquire these credentials.

### Running

Launch **`DiscordAudioBotTUI.exe`**, enter required credentials and configure your character in the settings. After configuring credentials, simply choose a **server**, **voice channel**, and **persona**, then press **Start** to connect.

For dashboard behavior, logging paths, and the settings editor, see [Textual dashboard](#textual-dashboard) under Development.

## Unimplemented Features

These are features that are planned or would be valuable additions to the project in the future.

- **SDK-agnostic interface for AI conversation**  
The current implementation is designed around a specific provider workflow. A provider-agnostic abstraction layer would make it possible to support multiple AI backends through a shared interface. This would allow the project to integrate with providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic or self-hosted local models without changing the surrounding bot logic. See [#13](https://github.com/magnus5405/discord-audio-bot/issues/13)

- **Local Speech-to-Text**  
The project currently depends on external speech recognition services. Adding support for local Speech-to-Text would make it possible to run the full voice pipeline on the user’s own machine or server. This would reduce API costs and lower latency in some environments. It would also open the door to supporting popular local transcription engines such as [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)-based solutions or other on-device speech recognition systems. See [#14](https://github.com/magnus5405/discord-audio-bot/issues/14)

- **Local Text-to-Speech**  
At the moment, voice synthesis depends on an external provider. This was chosen because ElevenLabs offer fair pricing and great voice models, with support for custom voices. Supporting local Text-to-Speech would allow fully self-hosted voice output, which would be useful for privacy-sensitive setups, offline environments, and users who want to avoid external API costs. It would also make the project more flexible for experimentation with custom voices and open-source speech models. See [#15](https://github.com/magnus5405/discord-audio-bot/issues/15)

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **[Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
- **[FFmpeg]()**: required for audio encode/decode when **running from source** (install on `PATH`). **Official Windows TUI builds** (installer and portable zip) ship **ffmpeg.exe** and **ffprobe.exe** next to the executable — no separate FFmpeg install for those.
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
  - Windows: [gyan.dev/ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip) or `choco install ffmpeg`

### Setup

#### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Magnus5405/discord-audio-bot.git
cd discord-audio-bot
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

#### Configuration: `.env` and `settings.json`
There are two layers:

1. **`.env`** — secrets and machine-local defaults (loaded via `python-dotenv` on startup).
   `.env.example` documents defaults for reply timing, STT backend, optional pricing hints, `DEBUG_MODE`, and `TUI_LOG_FILE`.
2. **`settings.json`** in the project root — personas, STT language, UI selections, and optional persisted API keys or Discord fields when you save from the TUI settings editor.
   When `settings.json` is missing, the app falls back to `settings-example.json` if present and creates `settings.json` on the first save.

**Precedence**:

- API secrets such as Gemini, STT, ElevenLabs, and Discord token are resolved with **values saved in `settings.json` first**, then fall back to environment variables

You can edit `settings.json` or generate it entirely from **Settings** inside the dashboard TUI (`python -m src.main --tui`). Released Windows bundles keep `settings-example.json` as reference-only and preserve an existing `settings.json` during updates.

**Encrypting secrets in `settings.json`:** Set **`SETTINGS_SECRET_KEY`** in `.env` with a Fernet key (44-character url-safe base64) to store API keys under `settings.api` or the Discord token under `settings.discord`. plaintext values are rejected on load.

**FFmpeg:** TTS playback uses FFmpeg. **Released Windows TUI builds** include FFmpeg next to `DiscordAudioBotTUI.exe`. When **developing from a clone**, install FFmpeg on `PATH` or set **`FFMPEG_PATH`** to the `ffmpeg` / `ffmpeg.exe` binary for a custom location.

**Slash commands (`/consent`, `/data`):** These are **application commands**, not normal chat messages. In Discord, type **`/`** and select this bot’s command from the menu (or tap the command suggestion). Typing `/consent accept` as plain text does nothing. The bot invite must include the **`applications.commands`** OAuth2 scope. For fastest registration in your server, set **`server_id`** in Settings (or **`DISCORD_SERVER_ID`** in `.env`) to your Discord server (guild) id, or run the bot in **only one** server so it can auto-register commands there. Otherwise global registration can take up to about an hour to appear everywhere. After connecting the TUI, check the **Activity log** for a line confirming slash command registration.

### Running

#### Headless smoke and pipeline checks

```bash
python -m src.main --list-voice-channels
python -m src.main --channel-id 123456789012345678 --audio-path /path/to/local-test-clip.mp3
python -m src.main --channel-id 123456789012345678 --audio-path /path/to/local-test-clip.mp3 --receive-smoke
python -m src.main --channel-id 123456789012345678 --transcribe
python -m src.main --channel-id 123456789012345678 --transcribe --listen-window-seconds 30
python -m src.main --channel-id 123456789012345678 --converse --listen-window-seconds 60
python -m src.main --tui
```

What these modes do:

1. Load `.env` and merge with `settings.json` where applicable.
2. Connect and print guild/voice channel IDs (`--list-voice-channels`).
3. Join a channel and play a local MP3/WAV once.
4. **Receive smoke** (`--receive-smoke`): listen, play the clip, listen again with a fresh sink; logs receive summaries.
5. **Transcription** (`--transcribe`): PCM receive, per-user STT, session JSON under `transcripts/`.
6. **Conversation** (`--converse`): same STT path as transcription, plus GenAI replies and ElevenLabs playback (requires keys and personas); usage fields updated in the session JSON.
7. Disconnect when the selected mode finishes (or on Ctrl+C).

If you set `DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` and `BOT_TEST_AUDIO_PATH`, you can run `python -m src.main` without repeating `--channel-id` / `--audio-path`.

#### Textual dashboard

```bash
python -m src.main --tui
```

Same credential expectations as full conversation mode. Do **not** combine `--tui` with `--converse`, `--transcribe`, `--channel-id`, or other headless flags.

- Pick a **server**, **voice channel**, and **persona**, then **Start**.
- Metrics refresh periodically (session time, STT audio minutes, GenAI tokens, TTS minutes).
- **Stop** ends the voice session cleanly; the bot stays logged in for another run.
- **Settings** (default binding: comma) opens the tabbed editor (personas, STT, Discord, API keys, cooldowns, pricing display).
- Logs go to **`logs/tui.log`** by default so the terminal stays clean; override with `TUI_LOG_FILE`.

#### Standalone settings editor

```bash
python -m src.ui.settings
```

Edits and saves `settings.json` without starting Discord.

### Format, lint, typecheck

```bash
ruff check src/ tests/
mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports --strict
```

### Tests

```bash
pytest
pytest -v
pytest tests/test_models.py
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Release branch (`latest`)

**Windows releases:** GitHub Actions produces **`DiscordAudioBotTUI-Setup.exe`** (Inno Setup) and a portable **`DiscordAudioBotTUI-windows.zip`**.

The repo ships **`settings-example.json`** as a neutral template beside the executable. Windows release builds no longer pre-create `settings.json`, and same-directory upgrades preserve any existing `settings.json`.

Production Windows releases are driven off the **`latest`** branch:

1. Open a pull request **into `latest`**. CI runs **lint / typecheck / tests** (same as other PRs) plus a **version check**: `pyproject.toml` `[project] version` and `src/__init__.py` `__version__` must **match** each other, and the version must be **strictly greater** than on the current `latest` tip (semver).
2. After merge, the [**Release**](.github/workflows/cd.yml) workflow runs on **`latest`**: it builds the Windows artifacts and creates a **GitHub Release** (and git tag **`v{version}`** from `[project] version`) via the release API. Pushes of `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not chain-trigger other workflows, so this path avoids a separate tag-push job.

## Architecture

End-to-end data flow:

```text
Discord voice receive $\rightarrow$ preprocessing / optional VAD $\rightarrow$ Google STT
  $\rightarrow$ conversation log + reply policy $\rightarrow$ Google GenAI $\rightarrow$ ElevenLabs TTS $\rightarrow$ Discord playback
```

`settings.json` and `.env` feed STT backend choice, languages, personas, API keys, and reply timing.

```

**Concurrency**: Discord runs on asyncio; voice sink callbacks may run off the main async path—forward work to `asyncio.Queue` with `loop.call_soon_threadsafe` instead of blocking. The Textual app has its own loop; the dashboard communicates with the Discord side via the session runner and shared settings/metrics—do not call Discord APIs from sink callbacks.

## Other considerations

### Voice encryption (DAVE)

Discord expects DAVE-capable clients. Keep `discord.py`, `PyNaCl`, `davey`, and related packages current. `discord.py`’s `[voice]` extra (pulled in by `discord-ext-voice-recv`) requires **PyNaCl below 1.6**; this repo matches that range so pip can resolve.

### Transcription language

If `settings.json` has no `stt` block, the app defaults to `en-US` with English alternatives where the code supplies them. Set `stt.language_code` and `stt.alternative_language_codes` for your session ([supported languages](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/speech-to-text-supported-languages)).

### Session-only memory

Conversation state is not persisted across runs; transcript JSON under `transcripts/` is for debugging and analysis.
