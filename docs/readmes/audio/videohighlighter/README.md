## Notes

Google Translate API is optional. If using unofficial libraries (googletrans), no API key is needed, but results may break if Google changes endpoints.

This project does not include any paid API keys. Users must provide their own if using official services.

## Project Background

This project started as a personal tool to automatically generate subtitles for videos, for my young 7 years old son. Over time, it evolved into a highlights generator for movies, sports, and personal videos.

The primary goal remains practical: speed up video analysis, generate highlights, and create accessible subtitles automatically.
