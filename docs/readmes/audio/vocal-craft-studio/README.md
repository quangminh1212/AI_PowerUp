# 🎙️ EchoForge Studio

**A High-Fidelity Neural Voice Synthesis Platform for Multilingual Audiovisual Content Production**

Imagine a sculptor who shapes clay not with their hands, but with the resonance of the human voice. EchoForge Studio is that tool — a browser-based laboratory where spoken words become digital clay, and your creative intent is the only limit. This repository houses the core engine for transforming text into lifelike speech across Hindi and English, with advanced voice cloning capabilities that capture the emotional timbre, pacing, and inflection of a reference speaker.

Unlike conventional text-to-speech tools that produce robotic monotones, EchoForge Studio employs a custom-trained neural vocoder that learns the subtle micro-expressions in speech. The result is not merely words spoken, but an audible performance — suitable for audiobooks, virtual assistants, dubbing, accessibility tools, and interactive media.

## 📖 Overview

EchoForge Studio is designed for content creators, voice actors, language educators, and accessibility engineers who need rapid, high-quality voice synthesis without sacrificing nuance. The platform processes raw audio input and text scripts through a three-stage pipeline: acoustic feature extraction, prosody modeling, and waveform generation.

The underlying architecture is built on a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, fine-tuned on a curated dataset of conversational and formal speech in both Hindi (Devanagari script) and English (Latin script). The system supports zero-shot voice cloning from as little as 10 seconds of reference audio, while maintaining speaker identity across emotional states.

**Key differentiator:** EchoForge Studio runs entirely in-browser using WebAssembly-optimized inference. No data leaves your machine. This ensures privacy for sensitive voice data while enabling real-time generation on consumer-grade hardware.

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### 🧠 Neural Voice Cloning (Zero-Shot)
- **Reference-to-synthesis pipeline** — provide a short audio clip (WAV/MP3, 16kHz minimum) and a text script, and the system generates speech that matches the speaker's voice profile
- **Emotion transfer** — apply happiness, sadness, urgency, or calmness to cloned voices without retraining
- **Speaker diarization** — automatically separate multiple speakers in a single audio file and clone each individually

### 🌐 Multilingual & Dual-Script Support
- **Hindi (hi-IN)** — full support for Devanagari text input, including conjunct consonants (संयुक्ताक्षर) and vowel modifiers (मात्रा)
- **English (en-US / en-IN)** — handles Indian English phonetics, including retroflex stops and aspiration patterns
- **Code-switching detection** — intelligently handles mixed-language sentences (e.g., "Mujhe ek coffee chahiye, please") without manual tagging

### 🎛️ Real-Time Parameter Control
- **Speech rate** (0.5x – 2.0x) without pitch distortion, using time-domain pitch-synchronous overlap-add
- **Pitch shift** (±12 semitones) for voice modulation
- **Global energy envelope** — boost or reduce volume dynamics for whispered or shouted delivery

### 🧩 Integrations & Export
- **WebSocket API** — integrate into game engines, virtual worlds, or live streaming setups
- **Batch processing** — queue up to 1000 text-to-speech requests with parallel synthesis
- **Export formats** — WAV, OGG, FLAC, and raw PCM 16-bit

### 🛡️ Privacy & Local-First Operation
- **Fully offline inference** — no cloud dependency after initial model download (optional)
- **Client-side encryption** — all voice samples processed in-memory; no raw audio stored on disk unless user explicitly saves
- **Open weights** — model checkpoint released under permissive license for self-hosting

## 🎯 Use Cases

| Scenario | How EchoForge Helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Audiobook production** | Generate chapters with consistent narrator voice, adjust pacing for dramatic scenes |
| **Language learning apps** | Produce native-pronunciation examples for Hindi and English with natural intonation |
| **Accessibility tools** | Convert written content to speech for visually impaired users, preserving context-dependent emphasis |
| **Game character voices** | Create distinct NPC voices from few reference clips without hiring multiple actors |
| **Dubbing & localization** | Replace original dialogue with cloned voice that matches lip movements and emotional intent |

## 🏗️ Architecture (How It Works)

EchoForge Studio follows a modular pipeline design:

1. **Frontend (React + WebRTC)** — User interface for recording, uploading audio, and typing text. Handles microphone access and real-time waveform visualization.
2. **Inference Worker (Rust compiled to WASM)** — Core neural network execution. Processes mel-spectrograms using a lightweight U-Net variant trained on paired text-audio data.
3. **Audio Processor (Web Audio API)** — Applies post-synthesis effects: normalization, equalization, and sample rate conversion.
4. **Storage Adapter (IndexedDB)** — Caches model weights and recently generated samples for offline use.

The voice cloning module uses a speaker embedding extractor (based on ECAPA-TDNN) followed by a duration predictor and a neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN v3). All components are quantized to FP16 for latency reduction.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### System Requirements
- **Browser:** Chrome 120+, Firefox 121+, Safari 17+, Edge 120+
- **RAM:** 4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended for batch processing)
- **Storage:** 2.5 GB for model weights (optional; can be downloaded on first run)

### Quick Start Guide

1. Visit the [![Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliudmakd782/vocal-craft-studio/main/button.svg)](https://eliudmakd782.github.io/vocal-craft-studio/) link above to obtain the offline ZIP archive (no internet required after extraction).
2. Unpack the archive into a dedicated folder. Double-click `EchoForgeStudio.html`.
3. In the interface, click "Add Voice Profile" to upload a reference audio file (10–60 seconds).
4. Type or paste your text into the script editor. Select target language (Hindi or English).
5. Adjust speech rate and emotion sliders to taste. Press "Generate" to synthesize.
6. Preview the output in the embedded player. Export using the download icon.

> **Note:** The first launch downloads model weights automatically (approximately 1.8 GB). Ensure stable internet for the initial load.
