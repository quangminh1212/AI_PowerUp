# ReachyClaw

**Your OpenClaw AI agent, embodied in a Reachy Mini robot.**

ReachyClaw makes OpenClaw the actual brain of a Reachy Mini robot. Unlike typical setups where GPT-4o handles conversations and only calls OpenClaw occasionally, ReachyClaw routes **every** user message through OpenClaw. The robot speaks, moves, and sees — all controlled by your OpenClaw agent.

OpenAI Realtime API is used purely for voice I/O (speech-to-text and text-to-speech). Your OpenClaw agent decides what to say **and** how the robot moves.

## Architecture

```
User speaks -> OpenAI Realtime API (STT only)
            -> GPT-4o calls ask_openclaw with the user's message
            -> OpenClaw (the actual brain) responds with text + action tags
            -> ReachyClaw parses action tags -> robot moves (emotions, look, dance)
            -> Clean text -> GPT-4o (TTS only) -> Robot speaks
```

OpenClaw can include action tags like `[EMOTION:happy]`, `[LOOK:left]`, `[DANCE:excited]` in its responses. These are parsed and executed on the robot, then stripped so only the spoken words go to TTS.

## Features

- **OpenClaw is the brain** — every message goes through your OpenClaw agent, not GPT-4o
- **Full body control** — OpenClaw controls head movement, emotions, dances, and camera
- **Real-time voice** — OpenAI Realtime API for low-latency speech I/O
- **Face tracking** — robot tracks your face and maintains eye contact
- **Camera vision** — robot can see through its camera and describe what it sees
- **Conversation memory** — OpenClaw maintains full context across sessions and channels
- **Works with simulator** — no physical robot required

## Available Robot Actions

OpenClaw can use these action tags in responses:

| Action | Tags |
|--------|------|
| **Look** | `[LOOK:left]` `[LOOK:right]` `[LOOK:up]` `[LOOK:down]` `[LOOK:front]` |
| **Emotion** | `[EMOTION:happy]` `[EMOTION:sad]` `[EMOTION:surprised]` `[EMOTION:curious]` `[EMOTION:thinking]` `[EMOTION:confused]` `[EMOTION:excited]` |
| **Dance** | `[DANCE:happy]` `[DANCE:excited]` `[DANCE:wave]` `[DANCE:nod]` `[DANCE:shake]` `[DANCE:bounce]` |
| **Camera** | `[CAMERA]` |
| **Face Tracking** | `[FACE_TRACKING:on]` `[FACE_TRACKING:off]` |
| **Stop** | `[STOP]` |

## Prerequisites

### Option A: With Physical Robot
- [Reachy Mini](https://www.pollen-robotics.com/reachy-mini/) robot (Wireless or Lite)

### Option B: With Simulator
- Any computer with Python 3.11+
- Install: `pip install "reachy-mini[mujoco]"`

### Software (Both Options)
- Python 3.11+
- [Reachy Mini SDK](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini)
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) gateway running
- OpenAI API key with Realtime API access

## Installation

### From the Reachy Mini App Store (recommended)

Install ReachyClaw directly from the Reachy Mini Control app. After installation, you must create a `.env` config file inside the app's venv so it can connect to OpenAI and your OpenClaw gateway.

The file goes here (on macOS):

```
~/Library/Application Support/com.pollen-robotics.reachy-mini/reachyclaw_venv/lib/python3.12/.env
```

Create it with:

```bash
cat > ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.pollen-robotics.reachy-mini/reachyclaw_venv/lib/python3.12/.env << EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://localhost:18789
OPENCLAW_TOKEN=your-gateway-token
OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID=main
EOF
```

**Where to find these values:**

- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** — from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). If you already have the Conversation app installed, you can copy the key from its `.env` file (same parent directory, under `conversation_venv`).
- **`OPENCLAW_TOKEN`** — your gateway auth token, found in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `gateway.auth.token`.
- **`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`** — defaults to `ws://localhost:18789` if OpenClaw runs on the same machine.

That's it — launch ReachyClaw from the app and it will work.

### From Source (CLI / development)

```bash
# Clone ReachyClaw
git clone https://github.com/EdLuxAI/reachyclaw
cd reachyclaw

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install
pip install -e ".[mediapipe_vision]"

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys
```

## Configuration

Edit `.env` (see `.env.example` for all options):

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...

# OpenClaw Gateway (required)
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://localhost:18789
OPENCLAW_TOKEN=your-gateway-token       # from ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json → gateway.auth.token
OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID=main

# Optional
OPENAI_VOICE=cedar
ENABLE_FACE_TRACKING=true
HEAD_TRACKER_TYPE=mediapipe
```

## Usage

### With Simulator

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start simulator
reachy-mini-daemon --sim

# Terminal 2: Run ReachyClaw
reachyclaw --gradio
```

### With Physical Robot

```bash
reachyclaw

# With debug logging
reachyclaw --debug

# With specific robot
reachyclaw --robot-name my-reachy
```

### CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging |
| `--gradio` | Launch web UI instead of console mode |
| `--robot-name NAME` | Specify robot name for connection |
| `--gateway-url URL` | OpenClaw gateway URL |
| `--no-camera` | Disable camera functionality |
| `--no-openclaw` | Disable OpenClaw integration |
| `--head-tracker TYPE` | Face tracker: `mediapipe` or `yolo` |
| `--no-face-tracking` | Disable face tracking |

## How It Differs from ClawBody

ClawBody (the stock app) uses GPT-4o as the brain and only calls OpenClaw occasionally for tools like calendar or weather. ReachyClaw inverts this:

| | ClawBody | ReachyClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Brain** | GPT-4o (with OpenClaw context snapshot) | OpenClaw (every message) |
| **Body control** | GPT-4o decides movements | OpenClaw decides movements |
| **Startup** | 20-30s context fetch from OpenClaw | Instant (no context fetch needed) |
| **Memory** | Stale snapshot from startup | Live OpenClaw memory |
| **GPT-4o role** | Full agent | Voice relay only |
