   ```
   ComfyUI/models/thinksound/
   ├── thinksound_light.ckpt
   ├── vae.ckpt
   ├── synchformer_state_dict.pth
   └── (other model files)
   ```

3. **Create the thinksound models folder if it doesn't exist:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ComfyUI/models/thinksound
   ```

### Step 5: Restart ComfyUI

1. **Restart ComfyUI completely**
2. **Check the console for successful loading messages:**
   ```
   🎉 ThinkSound modules imported successfully!
   ✅ SUCCESS: Found FeaturesUtils in thinksound.data.v2a_utils.feature_utils_224
   ```

## 🎛️ Usage

### Available Nodes

After installation, you'll find these nodes in ComfyUI:

1. **ThinkSound Model Loader**
   - Loads the main ThinkSound diffusion model
   - Input: `thinksound_model` (select your .ckpt file)
   - Output: `thinksound_model`

2. **ThinkSound Feature Utils Loader** 
   - Loads VAE and Synchformer models
   - Inputs: `vae_model`, `synchformer_model`
   - Output: `feature_utils`

3. **ThinkSound Sampler**
   - Generates audio from text and/or video
   - Main generation node

### Basic Workflow

```
ThinkSound Model Loader ──┐
                         ├── ThinkSound Sampler ── Audio Output
ThinkSound Feature Utils ─┘
Loader
```

### Sampler Node Parameters

- **Duration**: Audio length in seconds (1.0 - 30.0)
- **Steps**: Denoising steps (30 recommended)
- **CFG Scale**: Guidance strength (5.0 recommended)  
- **Seed**: Random seed for reproducibility
- **Caption**: Short audio description
- **CoT Description**: Detailed Chain-of-Thought prompt
- **Video**: Optional video input for video-to-audio generation

## 🎵 Examples

### Text-to-Audio Examples

**Example 1: Simple Audio**
```
Caption: "Dog barking"
CoT Description: "Generate the sound of a medium-sized dog barking outdoors. The barking should be natural and energetic, with slight echo to suggest an open space. Include 3-4 distinct barks with realistic timing between them."
```

**Example 2: Complex Scene**
```
Caption: "Ocean waves at beach"
CoT Description: "Create gentle ocean waves lapping against the shore. Add subtle sounds of water receding over sand and pebbles. Include distant seagull calls and a light ocean breeze for natural ambiance."
```

**Example 3: Musical Content**
```
Caption: "Jazz piano"
CoT Description: "Generate a smooth jazz piano melody in a minor key. Include syncopated rhythms, bluesy chord progressions, and subtle improvisation. The tempo should be moderate and relaxing, perfect for a late-night cafe atmosphere."
```

### Video-to-Audio Generation

1. **Load a video** using ComfyUI's video loader nodes
2. **Connect the video** to the ThinkSound Sampler's video input
3. **Add descriptive text** to guide the audio generation
4. **Generate audio** that syncs with the video content

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Model Precision
- **ThinkSound requires fp32 precision** for stable operation
- The nodes automatically use fp32 (no precision selection needed)
- Do not force fp16 as it may cause tensor dimension errors

### Memory Requirements
- **8GB VRAM minimum** for basic operation
- **12GB+ VRAM recommended** for longer audio generation
- **Enable "force_offload"** to save VRAM (enabled by default)

### Video Input Format
- **Supported**: MP4, AVI, MOV (any format ComfyUI can load)
- **Recommended**: 8-30 seconds duration
- **Processing**: Automatically handled by the node

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "ThinkSound source code not installed"**
```
Solution: Ensure you've downloaded the ThinkSound repository to the 'thinksound' folder
```

**Issue: "ImportError: No module named 'alias_free_torch'"**
```
Solution: Install missing dependencies:
pip install alias-free-torch==0.0.6 descript-audio-codec==1.0.0 vector-quantize-pytorch==1.9.14
```

**Issue: "Input type (float) and bias type (struct c10::Half) should be the same"**
```
Solution: This is resolved automatically with fp32 precision. Restart ComfyUI if you see this error.
```

**Issue: "Tensors must have same number of dimensions"**
```
Solution: Update to the latest version of the nodes. This was fixed in recent updates.
```

**Issue: Models not loading**
```
Solution: 
1. Check that models are in ComfyUI/models/thinksound/
2. Verify model file names match the dropdown options
3. Check ComfyUI console for specific error messages
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Start with shorter durations** (8-10 seconds) for testing
2. **Use lower step counts** (12-16) for faster generation during testing
3. **Enable force_offload** to manage VRAM usage
4. **Close other GPU-intensive applications** while generating

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Generation Times (approximate)
- **8 seconds audio**: 30-60 seconds on RTX 3080
- **15 seconds audio**: 60-120 seconds on RTX 3080
- **Video analysis**: Additional 10-20 seconds

### Quality Settings
- **Steps 12-16**: Fast, good quality
- **Steps 24**: Recommended balance
- **Steps 32+**: High quality, slower
