# Claude MLX TTS

Voice-cloned TTS notifications for Claude Code using [Chatterbox Turbo](https://www.resemble.ai/chatterbox/) on Apple Silicon.

When Claude finishes deep work, hear a brief AI-generated summary spoken aloud—so you know it's ready without watching the screen.

## Demo

## Features

- **Streaming TTS** - Audio starts in ~200ms instead of waiting for full generation
- **6 bundled voices** - `default`, `alex`, `jerry`, `scarlett`, `snoop`, `c3po` ready to use
- **Customization TUI** - Full terminal UI for voice, audio, and prompt configuration
- **Voice cloning** - Create new voices from WAV samples via Clone Lab
- **Dynamic compressor** - Professional-grade audio processing for consistent, punchy volume
- **AI-powered summaries** - Condenses Claude's response into a 10-15 word spoken update
- **Smart detection** - Only triggers on deep work (15+ seconds, 2+ tool calls, or thinking mode)
- **Zero config** - Works out of the box with bundled voice

## Quick Start

### Install

First, add this repo as a plugin marketplace:

```bash
# From terminal
claude plugin marketplace add aperepel/claude-mlx-tts

# Or from within a Claude Code session
/plugin marketplace add aperepel/claude-mlx-tts
```

Then install the plugin:

```bash
# From terminal
claude plugin install claude-mlx-tts

# Or from within a Claude Code session
/plugin install claude-mlx-tts
```

### Enable Voice Cloning (MLX on Apple Silicon)

After installation, enable MLX voice cloning:

```bash
# Install uv (if needed)
brew install uv        # or: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then in a Claude Code session:

```bash
/tts-init   # Install dependencies and download model (one-time, ~4GB)
/tts-start  # Start the TTS server (recommended)
```

**Why `/tts-start`?** Pre-warms the model in GPU memory for fast responses. Without it, each TTS request cold-loads the model (~10s delay). See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full backend fallback chain.

> **Note:** The default fp16 model is ~4GB and may take a while to download. See [Model Options](#model-options) for smaller quantized alternatives.

> [Full uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Marketplace Management

```bash
/plugin marketplace list                  # View all marketplaces
/plugin marketplace update claude-mlx-tts # Refresh plugins
/plugin marketplace remove claude-mlx-tts # Remove marketplace
```

### Test It

Verify the install with a smoke test:

```
/claude-mlx-tts:say Everything checks out and seems to be working. Great job!
```

Or trigger deep work to hear an automatic summary:

```
> think about what makes good API design
```

## Custom Voice

Clone your voice in seconds using Clone Lab:

1. Record a WAV sample (see [RECORDING.md](RECORDING.md) for tips)
2. Run `/tts-status` and launch the TUI
3. Open **Clone Lab** tab → select your WAV → create voice

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tts-init` | Install MLX dependencies and download model (~4GB) |
| `/tts-status` | Show config overview, available voices, and server status |
| `/tts-mute [duration]` | Mute TTS (`30m`, `until 5pm`, or indefinitely) |
| `/say <text>` | Speak text directly (smoke test) |
| `/summary-say <text>` | Summarize long text and speak it |
| `/tts-start` | Start server (pre-warms model for faster responses) |
| `/tts-stop` | Stop server (reclaims ~4GB GPU memory) |

## Configuration

Run `/tts-status` and launch the TUI to configure:

- **Voice Lab** — Per-voice audio controls (compressor, limiter, gain)
- **Clone Lab** — Create voices from WAV samples
- **Prompt Lab** — Customize voice and message per notification type

### Model Options

The default model is `chatterbox-turbo-fp16` (~4GB). For smaller memory footprint:

| Model | Size | Quality |
|-------|------|---------|
| `mlx-community/chatterbox-turbo-fp16` | ~4GB | Best |
| `mlx-community/chatterbox-turbo-8bit` | ~2GB | Good |
| `mlx-community/chatterbox-turbo-4bit` | ~1GB | Acceptable |
