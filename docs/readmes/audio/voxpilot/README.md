Talk to your IDE coding assistant with your voice. On-device speech recognition with multiple model options. No API keys. No cloud. Just your voice.

> "Hey Copilot, refactor this function to use async/await" — spoken, not typed.

## Why VoxPilot?

Every coding assistant requires typing. But sometimes your hands are busy, you have RSI, or you just think faster than you type. VoxPilot bridges voice and code by transcribing your speech and delivering it wherever you need — chat, cursor, or clipboard.

- **100% on-device** — Your audio never leaves your machine. Zero network calls.
- **3 model families** — Moonshine (fast), Whisper (90+ languages), Parakeet (streaming).
- **Works with any chat participant** — GitHub Copilot, Continue, Kiro, Cody, or any VS Code chat extension.
- **Real-time feedback** — Live partial transcripts as you speak, status bar states, audio waveform.
- **Smart text processing** — Auto-capitalize, auto-punctuate, voice commands, noise gate.
- **Flexible output** — Send to chat, insert at cursor, copy to clipboard, or choose each time.
- **Cross-platform** — Linux, macOS, Windows.
- **Open source** — MIT licensed. Fork it, extend it, ship it.

## Demo

```
[Ctrl+Alt+V] → 🎙️ "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication using JWT"
              → 📝 Transcribed and sent to Copilot Chat
              → 💻 Copilot generates the code
```

## Quick Start

1. Install from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/natearcher-ai/voxpilot)
2. Press `Ctrl+Alt+V` (`Cmd+Alt+V` on Mac)
3. Speak your prompt
4. VoxPilot transcribes and delivers it

First run downloads the ASR model. Takes about 10 seconds depending on model size.

## Audio Requirements

| Platform | Tool | Install |
|----------|------|---------|
| Linux | `arecord` | `sudo apt install alsa-utils` |
| macOS | `sox` | `brew install sox` |
| Windows | `ffmpeg` | [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org) |

VoxPilot checks on activation and tells you if something's missing.

## Models

VoxPilot supports three model families. Use the **Model Manager** in the activity bar to browse, download, switch, and delete models.

### Moonshine (Useful Sensors)
Fast, lightweight, English-focused. Great for quick commands.

|-------|------|-------|----------|
| Moonshine Tiny | ~27MB | Fastest | Quick commands, short prompts |
| Moonshine Base | ~65MB | Fast | Longer dictation, better accuracy |

### Whisper (OpenAI)
Multi-language support with 90+ languages. Best for non-English or mixed-language use.

| Model | Size | Languages | Use case |
|-------|------|-----------|----------|

## How It Works

```
Microphone → PCM Audio → Noise Gate → Voice Activity Detection → ASR Model (ONNX) → Post-Processing → Delivery
```

1. Native audio capture via CLI tools (arecord/sox/ffmpeg)
2. Noise gate filters constant background noise
3. Adaptive VAD with noise-floor calibration detects speech
4. On-device ASR model transcribes via ONNX Runtime
5. Post-processing: capitalize, punctuate, voice commands
6. Delivery to chat, cursor, or clipboard

## Privacy & Trust

All processing happens on your device. No telemetry. No analytics. No network calls (except one-time model download from HuggingFace). Your voice data is never stored or transmitted.

🛡️ **Trust signals:**
- **Zero telemetry** — No usage tracking, no analytics, no phone-home. Verified by source code.
- **Zero cloud** — Audio is processed entirely on-device via ONNX Runtime. No data leaves your machine.
- **Zero data collection** — No accounts, no sign-ups, no personal information gathered.
- **Fully auditable** — MIT-licensed, open source. Read every line of code that touches your microphone.
- **Minimal permissions** — Only requests microphone access. No network, no filesystem beyond model cache.
- **Privacy policy** — Clear, human-readable [privacy policy](https://natearcher-ai.github.io/voxpilot/privacy.html) with no legalese.
