# VoiceForge - CPU-Optimized Voice Cloning and Text-to-Speech Platform

VoiceForge is an enterprise-grade, CPU-optimized voice cloning, text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, and multi-speaker podcast generation platform. It is engineered using a Next.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and is powered by Kyutai Labs' Pocket-TTS model. VoiceForge offers a complete studio environment, allowing users to clone custom voices from short audio samples, build node-based audio pipelines, and script multi-speaker podcasts with a virtual studio stage.

---

## System Overview

VoiceForge enables local voice cloning and audio synthesis without requiring specialized GPU hardware. By leveraging the CPU-optimized Pocket-TTS model, it achieves rapid inference times and high-quality voice reproductions. The platform is structured around two distinct operational environments:

1. **The Voice Lab**: A visual, node-based pipeline editor built on React Flow that lets developers and creators design, tune, and test voice cloning and TTS configurations step-by-step.
2. **The Podcast Studio**: A screenplay-based screenplay-writing editor and virtual studio stage that allows creators to script multi-speaker podcasts, cast cloned voices, and generate continuous, stitched high-fidelity podcasts.

## Key Capabilities

- **Zero-GPU Voice Cloning**: Extract speaker characteristics and register voice models from any audio prompt (minimum 30 seconds of high-fidelity speech) using only CPU resources.
- **Node-Based Audio Pipelines**: Interactively construct audio pipelines by chaining voice inputs, style tuners, screenplay nodes, and post-processing filters.
- **Post-Processing Audio Effects**: Apply high-fidelity, independent speed and pitch adjustments using Librosa spectral analysis, allowing vocal pacing and tone shifting without causing phase distortion or timing errors.
- **Automated Denoising & Normalization**: Preprocess user uploads through an integrated pipeline featuring noise gating, spectral subtraction, and standard WAV formatting to maximize clone fidelity.
- **Real-Time Progress Streaming**: Monitor heavy inference workloads using a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream, providing live feedback and task updates to the client.
- **Screenplay Script Parsing**: Automatically parse multi-speaker scripts in screenplay format (`Speaker Name: Dialogue text`), distribute tasks to parallel worker threads, and dynamically assemble the final podcast.

---

## Technical Architecture and Data Flow

VoiceForge's architecture decouples core computational heavy lifting from UI interactions through an asynchronous service layer.

### Core Architecture Components

- **FastAPI Backend**: Orchestrates system requests, serves as an endpoint interface, handles file uploads, and acts as the runtime controller for Pocket-TTS and post-processing tasks.
- **Pocket-TTS Engine**: Integrates with Kyutai Labs' model weights (`b6369a24`) to execute voice state registration and neural speech synthesis.
- **Next.js Frontend**: Implements the user interfaces, incorporating React Flow for graph editing, Zustand for state synchronization, and WaveSurfer.js for audio waveform visualization.

### Pipeline Nodes in the Voice Lab

The visual canvas utilizes five custom React Flow nodes to structure speech synthesis:

1. **Voice Input Node**: Receives user-uploaded source audio files or record inputs, serving as the vocal template for cloning.
2. **Voice DNA Node**: Interacts with the backend to trigger state-creation and displays metadata for cloned speaker states.
3. **Script Node**: Houses the text screenplay or dialogue segment to be synthesized.
4. **Style Tuning Node**: Configures generation parameters, including speech velocity (speed) and pitch modulation (semitones).
5. **Output Node**: Connects to the backend generation endpoint, plays the synthesized audio, and renders its spectral waveform.

## Detailed Troubleshooting

### 1. MP3 Processing and FFmpeg Errors
* **Symptom**: System reports "Failed to process audio" or encounters library load failures when uploading non-WAV formats.
* **Cause**: The system depends on FFmpeg to convert MP3, M4A, FLAC, and WebM formats to standard WAV before cloning. If the bundled FFmpeg is missing or blocked, the pydub backend fails.
* **Resolution**:
  - Verify that `backend/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl/bin/ffmpeg.exe` exists and has standard read/execute privileges.
  - Alternatively, ensure FFmpeg is added to your operating system's PATH variable.

### 2. Hugging Face Access Denied or Weight Download Failures
* **Symptom**: Console throws an error stating "We could not download the weights for the model b6369a24."
* **Cause**: Pocket-TTS is a restricted-weight model. You must accept Kyutai Labs' terms of service on their model repository page prior to local initialization.
* **Resolution**:
  - Visit [kyutai/pocket-tts](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/pocket-tts) in your browser and log in with your Hugging Face credentials.
  - Formally accept the licensing agreement.
  - Run the `backend/hf_login.py` script or execute `huggingface-cli login` in your terminal to cache your authentication state.

### 3. Port Already in Use (Address Conflict)
* **Symptom**: Backend FastAPI server fails to start with standard "Address already in use" errors.
* **Cause**: A background uvicorn or next.js process from a previous workspace run is still occupying ports 8000 or 3000.
* **Resolution**:
  - Run the included python script to clean existing ports:
    ```bash
    python backend/kill_port.py
    ```
  - Alternatively, identify and kill the processes manually on Windows:
    ```powershell
    netstat -ano | findstr :8000
    taskkill /F /PID <PID_FOUND>
    ```

### 4. Low Fidelity Clones or Vocal Distortion
* **Symptom**: The cloned voice sounds robotic, has a lot of static, or displays excessive background resonance.
* **Cause**: The original audio prompt has high noise floor, background music, or the speaker is too close to the microphone.
* **Resolution**:
  - Upload an audio file with at least 30 seconds of clean, continuous speech.
  - Ensure the source audio sample rate is high (minimum 16kHz, recommended 24kHz or 48kHz).
  - Let the integrated VoiceForge denoiser filter the input. Avoid pre-processing with severe filters that destroy vocal frequencies.
