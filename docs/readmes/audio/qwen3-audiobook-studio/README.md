- **Role-Based Synthesis**: Use a standard `Role: Dialogue` format.

- **Director's Tags**: Use `[p=dur]` (e.g., `[p=1.5]`) to insert precise silence segments.

### 2. 🎨 AI Voice Designer
- **Generative TTS**: Describe a voice (e.g., "Deep, raspy male voice with a slight British accent") and hear it instantly.
- **One-Click Save**: Like the voice? Save it to your `./voices` library with one click and use it in your next book.

### 3. 🧬 State-of-the-Art Cloning
- **Zero-Shot**: Clone any voice from a 5-second sample with near-perfect fidelity.
