## 🛠️ Installation

VoxLibri is designed to be self-contained. The `build.py` script manages the entire environment for you.

### Prerequisites (Linux)
Ensure you have the basic build tools. Most other dependencies are handled automatically.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-venv git
```

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vasanth2005kk/VoxLibri.git
   cd VoxLibri
   ```

2. **Run the installer and launcher:**
   ```bash
   python3 build.py
   ```
   *This will create a virtual environment, install system dependencies (Calibre, FFmpeg, Tesseract), and launch the application.*
