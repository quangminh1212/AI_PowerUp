## ELI5

Bao Translate is a tiny interpreter that runs on your Android phone. You speak, it captions and translates the words, then it speaks the translation out loud. If you enroll a short local voice profile, translated speech can be converted toward your timbre. After the model stack is downloaded, conversation audio and voice profiles stay on the device.

It also carries **LibreDrop**: two phones on the same Wi-Fi can send each other files directly. One phone announces itself on the network, the other finds it, they do a secret handshake, both screens show the same 4-digit number so you can check you're talking to the right phone, and then the file goes across. Nothing touches a server.

## What It Does

- **Live speech translation:** microphone audio flows through local VAD, STT, translation, TTS, and playback.
- **Streaming captions:** English uses a sherpa-onnx Zipformer transducer; 10 other languages use lazy Vosk caption models; Arabic falls back to chunked Whisper captions.
- **On-device translation:** Qwen2.5 1.5B is the required LiteRT-LM translation model; Gemma 4 E2B is an optional upgrade.
- **On-device speech:** Kokoro handles en/es/fr/hi/it/pt/zh; optional Supertonic handles de/ja/ko/ru/ar; Android platform TTS is the fallback when a supplemental voice is unavailable.
- **Voice cloning:** OpenVoice ONNX tone conversion is provisioned with the required stack and is applied when a local or peer voice profile is available.
- **Conversation modes:** face-to-face use, continuous translation, per-speaker language selection, Bluetooth audio routing, and Nearby Connections relay between Android devices.
- **Model management:** downloads are curated, status-tracked, resumable, integrity-checked, and visible in the app.
- **LibreDrop peer-to-peer transfer:** a from-scratch implementation of the Quick Share wire protocol (UKEY2 handshake, D2D key derivation, SecureMessage channel, chunked payloads) with send and receive over Wi-Fi LAN. See [docs/LIBREDROP.md](docs/LIBREDROP.md) for the protocol, security properties, and the parts that are not wired yet.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  mic["Microphone"] --> vad["Silero VAD"]
  vad --> stt["Whisper Base STT"]
  vad -. live audio .-> caption{"Caption route"}
  caption -->|en| sherpa["sherpa-onnx Zipformer"]
  caption -->|"es/fr/de/zh/ja/ko/pt/it/ru/hi"| vosk["Vosk small model"]
  caption -->|"ar or missing model"| chunked["chunked Whisper fallback"]
  stt --> translate["LiteRT-LM translation"]
  translate --> tts{"TTS router"}
  tts -->|"en/es/fr/hi/it/pt/zh"| kokoro["Kokoro"]
  tts -->|"de/ja/ko/ru/ar if installed"| supertonic["Supertonic"]
  tts -->|fallback| platform["Android platform TTS"]
  kokoro --> clone{"Voice profile?"}
  supertonic --> clone
  platform --> clone
  clone -->|yes| openvoice["OpenVoice tone conversion"]
  clone -->|"no or conversion fails"| playback["Audio playback"]
  openvoice --> playback
  playback --> speaker["Speaker or selected output"]
  playback -. Nearby relay .-> peer["Paired Android device"]
```

The live caption path is optimized for responsiveness while Whisper provides the final transcript used for translation. The TTS router chooses the best local speech engine for the target language, then OpenVoice can convert the synthesized audio toward the enrolled speaker timbre.

## Model Provisioning

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  firstRun["First app run"] --> required["Required readiness gate"]
  required --> whisper["Whisper Base STT - 148 MB"]
  required --> qwen["Qwen2.5 1.5B translation - 1.5 GB"]
  required --> silero["Silero VAD - 2 MB"]
  required --> kokoro["Kokoro TTS - 142 MB app estimate"]
  required --> openvoice["OpenVoice tone conversion - 125 MB app estimate"]

  firstRun --> auto["Auto-provisioned upgrade"]
  auto --> streaming["English streaming ASR - 44 MB"]

  settings["Optional settings download"] --> gemma["Gemma 4 E2B translation - 2.5 GB"]
  settings --> supertonic["Supertonic TTS - 80 MB"]

  languageUse["First use of non-English caption language"] --> vosk["Lazy Vosk caption model - 32 to 86 MB each"]
```

Required models must be ready before the core translation loop is considered ready. The English streaming caption model is auto-provisioned but does not block the required readiness gate. Vosk caption models are downloaded only when a language needs them.

## Conversation Relay

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Device A
  participant B as Device B
  A->>A: Capture, caption, transcribe
  A->>A: Translate into listener language
  A->>B: Send Nearby payload and speaker metadata
  B->>B: Synthesize translated speech
  B->>B: Apply peer timbre when available
  B->>B: Play through selected output route
```

Nearby Connections is used for the two-device mesh. Each side can keep its own source and target language, and peer timbre metadata lets the receiving device speak the translation in the other speaker's voice profile when available.

## LibreDrop File Transfer

LibreDrop speaks the Quick Share wire protocol directly — the transfer itself does not go through Google Play Services. Receiving runs in a `connectedDevice` foreground service so the device stays reachable while the app is backgrounded; it is opt-in and off by default.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant S as Sender
  participant R as Receiver
  Note over R: "Receive files" ON → foreground service → TCP listener + mDNS advertise
  S->>R: mDNS resolve, then TCP connect
  S->>R: ConnectionRequest
  S->>R: UKEY2 ClientInit
  R->>S: UKEY2 ServerInit
  S->>R: UKEY2 ClientFinished
  Note over S,R: D2D keys derived (HKDF). Both compute the same 4-digit PIN.
  S->>R: IntroductionFrame (names, sizes, payload ids)
  Note over R: Consent notification — user taps Accept or Reject
  R->>S: ConnectionResponseFrame{ACCEPT}
  loop per 512 KiB chunk
    S->>R: PayloadTransferFrame{DATA}
  end
  S->>R: LAST_CHUNK, then Disconnection
```

| Capability | State |
| --- | --- |
| Receive over Wi-Fi LAN | Working |
| Send over Wi-Fi LAN | Working |
| Wi-Fi Direct / hotspot / Bluetooth upgrade | Medium providers exist; the sender does not negotiate a bandwidth upgrade |
| Consent surface | In-app modal (`LibreDropConsentActivity`) with heads-up notification actions as fallback; both drive the same decision sink |
| QR pairing, AI file descriptions, voice share | Code present, no UI entry point |

Peer-supplied filenames are sanitized before they reach MediaStore or a `File` — separators, control characters, NUL, leading dots and `..` segments are all neutralised. Full detail, including known gaps, is in [docs/LIBREDROP.md](docs/LIBREDROP.md).

## Privacy And Trust Boundaries

Everything after provisioning runs locally: speech, transcript, translation, synthesis and voice conversion never leave the device, and LibreDrop transfers go peer-to-peer without a relay server. The boundaries that data does cross are handled explicitly.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph onDevice["Stays on device"]
    audio["Microphone audio, transcripts, voice profiles"]
    store["App storage - models, skills, downloads"]
  end
  logcat["logcat"]
  peer["Paired or nearby device"]
  web["Skill WebView content"]
  audio -->|"release builds drop v and d"| logcat
  audio -->|"Nearby relay, conversation modes only"| peer
  peer -->|"LibreDrop - consent required, filenames sanitized"| store
  web -->|"origin checked, storage quotas enforced"| store
```

| Boundary | Control | Proven by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diagnostic logging | `BaoLog.shouldEmit` drops `v` and `d` in release builds — those are the levels where call sites interpolated typed input and model responses. `i`/`w`/`e` survive for field bug reports and are expected to carry shapes, not content. Release does not minify, so nothing else would have stripped them. | `BaoLogTest` |
| Inbound files | Every peer-supplied name goes through `FilenameSanitizer` before MediaStore or a `File`; a transfer only starts after an explicit Accept in `LibreDropConsentActivity` or its notification fallback. Receiving is opt-in and off on a fresh install. | `FilenameSanitizerTest`, `ConsentIntentsTest`, `LibreDropConsentActivityTest`, `ReceiveModePreferencesTest` |
| Skill WebView | `isTrustedLocalWebViewUrl` compares full origin (scheme, host, port) rather than prefix, so userinfo spoofing and look-alike hosts are rejected; the WebView runs JavaScript, so this is the gate. | `WebViewTrustAndFileNameTest` |
| Skill storage bridge | `SkillStorageBridge` caps what page JavaScript can persist before it reaches `SharedPreferences`: keys ≤ 256 chars, values ≤ 64 KiB, 512 entries total, with a rejected write returning `false` rather than throwing. | `SkillStorageBridgeTest` |
| Imported model names | `ensureValidFileName` replaces path separators and everything outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. Its one documented gap — leading dots are not stripped — is pinned by a test rather than left implicit. | `WebViewTrustAndFileNameTest` |

## Supported Languages

## Getting Started

Requirements:

- Android 12 / API 31 or newer.
- Enough local storage for the selected model stack.
- Network access for initial model downloads.
- Optional Bluetooth headset or second Android device for advanced conversation testing.

Steps:

1. Install an APK you have access to, or build from source.
2. Launch the app and download the required models.
3. Optional: enroll your voice in settings.
4. Choose source and target languages, pick audio devices if needed, and start translating.

Source builds that need gated in-app model downloads also need the Hugging Face OAuth Gradle properties or environment variables described in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Build From Source

The Android Gradle project is rooted at [Android/src](Android/src).

```bash
cd Android/src

./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
./gradlew :app:smokeE2e

adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Build notes:

- `applicationId = com.google.ai.edge.gallery`.
- `versionName = 1.0.15`; `versionCode = 33`.
- `compileSdk = 37`; `minSdk = 31`; `targetSdk = 37`.
- The wrapper uses Gradle 9.6.1 with AGP 9.4.0-alpha02 and Kotlin 2.4.20-Beta1.
- Gradle toolchains use JDK 26 for compilation and emit Java 17 bytecode.
- The vendored `sherpa-onnx` AAR lives under `Android/src/app/libs/`.
- Verification task definitions are applied from `Android/src/gradle/verification.gradle.kts`; they are kept outside the module directory because Android Lint's build-script pass crashes when it tries to resolve an applied `.gradle.kts` that has no compilation classpath of its own.
- `kotlinx-coroutines-test` is a test-only dependency pinned to the same version as `kotlinx-coroutines-core`; the two must match or the internal `TestCoroutineScheduler` wiring breaks at runtime.
- `sherpa-onnx` and `onnxruntime-android` both ship `libonnxruntime.so`; packaging keeps one shared object with `jniLibs.pickFirsts`.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for local setup, Hugging Face OAuth configuration, and verification notes.

## Quality And Verification

Current state of the JVM unit suite:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Unit tests | 563 passing, 0 failing, 0 skipped, 46 classes |
| Strict gate (`@Category(Strict)`) | 563 of 563 — every class carries the marker, so the whole suite is gating |
| LibreDrop tests | 154 |
| Instrumentation tests | 105 `@Test` methods, device or emulator required |
| Android Lint (debug) | 0 errors, 26 warnings |

The single gate that runs everything:

```bash
cd Android/src
./gradlew :app:verifyReleaseReady
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  gate["verifyReleaseReady"] --> compile["compileDebugKotlin"]
  gate --> compileAt["compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin"]
  gate --> unit["testDebugUnitTest - 563"]
  gate --> strict["testDebugUnitTestStrict - 563"]
  gate --> lint["lintDebug"]
  gate --> apk["assembleDebug"]
  gate --> apkAt["assembleDebugAndroidTest"]
  device["Device gates - not in verifyReleaseReady"] --> smoke["smokeE2e"]
  device --> connected["connectedDebugAndroidTest - 105"]
```

The strict task reuses the exact compiled classes and runtime classpath of `testDebugUnitTest` and
filters them through JUnit 4 categories, so it runs the same bytecode rather than a parallel build.
The task definitions live in
[gradle/verification.gradle.kts](Android/src/gradle/verification.gradle.kts), outside the module
directory for the Lint reason noted in the build notes above.

Device gates, which need hardware or an emulator:

```bash
./gradlew :app:smokeE2e
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

### Known false-green surfaces in the instrumentation suite

The 105 `@Test` methods under `androidTest` are **not** as strict as the JVM suite. An audit of the
real source found five places where a green run does not mean the behaviour was proven:

| Test | Why a pass can be empty |
| --- | --- |
| `BaoTranslateLiveMicTranslationE2eTest.twoDevice_sendsTranscriptToLivePeerOverNearby` | `assumeTrue(peer != null)` — with one device attached the "two-device proof" reports success having proven nothing. |
| `BaoTranslateLiveMicTranslationE2eTest.receivedPeerMessageUsesPeerTimbreWhenEmbeddingPresent` | Routed through `ensureOpenVoiceReady`, which `assumeTrue`s that the OpenVoice ONNX files are provisioned. On a device without them the timbre assertions never execute. |
| `BaoTranslateLiveMicTranslationE2eTest.receivedPeerMessageWithoutEmbeddingDoesNotUseLocalVoice` | Same `ensureOpenVoiceReady` skip. |
| `BaoTranslateBluetoothAudioRoutingTest.audioRouter_cleanup_idempotent` | No assertion — passes if `cleanup()` became a no-op. |
| `BaoTranslateDeviceAudioRouteTest.audioRouter_play_thenReset_isSafe` | No assertion — same. |

Read a green `connectedDebugAndroidTest` accordingly: the two-device Nearby path is only actually
exercised when a second device is present and in Conversation Mode, and the voice-conversion path
only when the OpenVoice models are already on the device.

The JVM suite is stricter but not perfect. None of its 563 methods are `@Ignore`d and `skipped=0` in
every run; its three `assume*` calls all sit in `ModelIntegrityTest` (two symlink-capability guards
and one POSIX-only guard) and none of them fired on this machine. Five methods are crash-only
contracts that assert nothing and fail only if the code under test throws —
`VadProcessorTest.reset_idempotent`, `cleanup_calledTwice_safe`, `concurrentCalls_serializedAndSafe`
(deliberately, since thread interleaving is not deterministic),
`VoiceProfileManagerTest.deleteProfile_idempotent_forMissingProfile`, and
`StrictHarnessTest.whitespaceTorture_doesNotPanic_onAnyEntry`. Everything else asserts, including the
kotest `forAll` property tests, which fail on falsification.

Three hardening rules the suite enforces on itself, not just on production code:

- `CrossCuttingHardeningTest.runBlockingWithTimeout_isRequired` statically scans the test tree and
  fails if any `runBlocking` is not paired with a `withTimeout`, so a hung coroutine cannot masquerade
  as a slow test.
- `smokeE2e` parses the instrumentation output rather than trusting the exit code, because
  `adb shell am instrument` returns 0 even when tests fail or the process crashes.
- `DeadSurfaceGuardTest` re-derives the set of production types with no caller in any source set and
  fails on anything newly unreferenced. The compiler happily builds code nobody calls and Lint's
  unused-symbol checks do not span source sets, which is how 2,941 lines of shipped-but-unwired
  Kotlin accumulated unnoticed. Its 17 known-dead entries are listed with a reason each — mostly the
  non-Wi-Fi-LAN bootstrap clients the sender never negotiates, plus the QR-pairing and "AI
  assistance" surfaces with no UI entry point. The list is a ratchet: shrinking it is progress,
  growing it has to be deliberate.

### Thinnest coverage

Measured Kotlin LOC per package, `main` against its own unit tests:

| Package | main | unit test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `customtasks/libredrop` | 45,105 | 2,611 |
| `ui/common` | 15,089 | 363 |
| `customtasks/baotranslate` | 13,774 | 3,792 |
| `customtasks/agentchat` | 8,233 | 0 |
| `ui/modelmanager` | 3,255 | 0 |

The largest remaining gaps are **not** in LibreDrop — that went from the worst-covered area to among
the best. `customtasks/agentchat` is the biggest package with no unit tests at all, and `ui/common`
has only the first two (`WebViewTrustAndFileNameTest` for WebView origin trust and imported-model
file naming, `SkillStorageBridgeTest` for the JavaScript storage bridge's quotas) against 15k lines.
Those two packages are where the next coverage work belongs.

### What is not covered

Unit tests do not reach the LibreDrop foreground-service lifecycle (`ReceiverForegroundService`),
BLE discovery, the Wi-Fi Direct / hotspot medium providers, or the notification builders. Those
need instrumentation on a device, or a service refactor small enough to sit behind a Robolectric
harness.

Robolectric itself is available and now carries four classes — `ReceiveModePreferencesTest` against a
real `SharedPreferences`, `LibreDropConsentActivityTest` against the consent trampoline's defensive
paths, `WebViewTrustAndFileNameTest` against Android's own `Uri` parser, and `SkillStorageBridgeTest`
against the storage bridge — with two toolchain caveats recorded in the build: its bundled ASM cannot read
Java 26 class files, so `tasks.withType<Test>` pins a JDK 21 launcher; and it ships emulated
frameworks only up to SDK 36, so Robolectric tests carry `@Config(sdk = [36])`. The pin is
4.16.1 (latest stable); 4.17-beta-2 accepts SDK 37 but fails on both JDK 21 and 26, so neither
workaround can be dropped yet.

Use a physical device for full translation, microphone capture, Bluetooth audio routing, voice cloning, and Nearby conversation validation. Emulator coverage is useful for compile, unit, and focused UI checks, but it does not replace hardware verification for the audio pipeline. A LibreDrop transfer between two real devices likewise cannot be proven by the loopback test alone, which exercises the protocol but not the radio.
