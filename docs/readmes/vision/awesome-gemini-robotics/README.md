> **What is Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5?**
> It’s Google’s state-of-the-art embodied reasoning model for robotics. ER 1.5 excels at **spatial understanding (2D points, boxes, trajectories)**, **long-horizon task planning**, **temporal reasoning on video**, **tool use (e.g., Google Search)**, and **success/progress estimation**. You can call it directly via Google AI Studio / Gemini API and orchestrate your own robot APIs or VLAs. ([Google Developers Blog][1])

## Quick start

> Minimal Python sketch with the Gemini API (model name may appear as `gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview` in early access):

```python
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
MODEL_ID = "gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview"

prompt = """
Point to no more than 10 items in the image.
Return [{"point":[y,x],"label":"<name>"}] with y/x normalized to 0-1000.
"""

img_bytes = open("scene.jpg","rb").read()
res = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=[types.Part.from_bytes(data=img_bytes, mime_type="image/jpeg"), prompt],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        temperature=0.5,
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_budget=0)  # tune if needed
    )
)
print(res.text)
```

This mirrors Google’s official robotics overview (points, trajectories, orchestration, video, etc.). See docs for more examples (object tracking, packing lunch, calling custom robot APIs). ([Google AI for Developers][2])

**Output**

Success? No

**Prompt**

```
For this task, you will see a robot or human trying to perform the task of putting the mango into the brown container.
You may see multiple camera views of the same scene. Some cameras are static
and are mounted outside of the scene and some cameras are mounted on the robot arms
and thus they are moving during the episode. The first 4 images show multiple
camera views from the start of the episode (some time ago). The last 4 images show
multiple camera views from the current moment in the episode (as it is now).
Looking at these images and comparing the start of the episode with current state did
the robot successfully perform the task "put the mango into the brown container"?
Answer only with (1) yes or (2) no. Return the number (1) or (2) that best answers the question.

```

ER 1.5 can **call tools** (e.g., Google Search) and output **interleaved text + points** for “spatially grounded” plans. ([Google Developers Blog][1])

### 30) **Re-organize my desk** from a reference photo (long-horizon plan) 🧩

**Prompt**

```
Given (A) my current desk photo and (B) a reference photo,
create a step-by-step reorganization plan.
For each step include target placements as [{"box_2d":[ymin,xmin,ymax,xmax],"label":"<item>"}],
normalized 0-1000, and a 1-2 sentence rationale.
```

Demonstrates **agentic planning** with **spatial grounding** over many steps. ([Google Developers Blog][1])

---

### 31) **Make room for a laptop** (choose what to move) 🧩

![Make room](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/images/robotics/spatial-reasoning.png)

**Prompt**

```
Point to the single object I should remove to make room for my laptop.
Return [{"point":[y,x],"label":"<object to move>"}], normalized 0-1000.
```

A canonical **orchestration** example from the docs—reason about constraints and pick the minimal change. ([Google AI for Developers][2])

---

### 32) **Pack a lunch** with spatially grounded instructions ✅

![Packing lunch](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/robotics/packing-lunch.png)

**Prompt**

```
Explain how to pack the lunch box and lunch bag from this image.
Point to each object you refer to:
[{"point":[y,x],"label":"<name>"}], normalized 0-1000.
Return a numbered step-by-step plan.
```

Outputs a **multi-step plan** plus points you can render or convert into pick-and-place calls. ([Google AI for Developers][2])

---

### 33) **Pick-and-place via your robot API** (function-calling) 🧩

![Blocks & bowl](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/images/robotics/robot-api-example.png)

**Prompt**

```
First, locate the blue block and the orange bowl with:
[{"point":[y,x],"label":"<name>"}], 0-1000.
Then, using ONLY these functions:
  def move(x, y, high: bool)
  def setGripperState(opened: bool)
  def returnToOrigin()
Generate the precise call sequence to pick the block and place it in the bowl.
Explain each call briefly.
```

Docs show this pattern end-to-end (detect → plan → call your API). ([Google AI for Developers][2])

---

### 34) **Move the red pen to the organizer** (trajectory planning) 🧩

![Pen trajectory](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/images/robotics/trajectories.png)

**Prompt**

```
Place a point on the red pen, then 15 points for its trajectory onto the organizer.
Label points by order "0"..."15". Return [{"point":[y,x],"label":"<step>"}].
```

Great for **teaching-by-trajectory** and downstream spline fitting / time-parametrization. ([Google AI for Developers][2])

---

### 35) **Laundry sorting by color** (multi-level thinking) 🧩

[![](https://i.imgur.com/2fqyZh6.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDyXEh8XqjM&t=34s)


**Prompt**

```
Sort laundry by color into two baskets: white vs non-white.
Return a short natural-language plan and for each garment a
{"point":[y,x],"label":"white|non-white"} with normalized 2D coordinates.
```

Official blog explains how Robotics 1.5/ER 1.5 think at task/subtask/micro-action levels for chores like **color-sorting laundry**. ([blog.google][3])

---

### 36) **Payload-aware pick** (safety & constraints) 🧩


**Prompt**

```
Plan a pick-and-place for the heaviest visible item
subject to a 1.0 kg payload limit and a 25 cm reach radius.
Explain the constraint checks and refuse if unsafe.
Return [{"point":[y,x],"label":"grasp"}] plus "reason".
```

ER 1.5 adds improved semantic safety and awareness of physical constraints; you must still implement hardware-level safety. ([Google Developers Blog][1])

---

### 37) **Human-robot natural language**: “Clean up the table” 🧩

![Table cleanup](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-developer-goog-blog-assets/images/image12_O0rW8PY.original.png)

**Prompt**

```
Given a table scene image, produce a numbered cleanup plan.
For each step, include a target placement point or 2D box and a note on success criteria.
Format:
{"step":n,"action":"...","target":{"point":[y,x] | "box_2d":[ymin,xmin,ymax,xmax]},"why":"..."}
```

ER 1.5 breaks down ambiguous commands into executable sub-goals and can call specialized grasping/VLA skills to act. ([Google Developers Blog][1])

---

### 38) **Cross-embodiment planning** (robot-agnostic steps) 🧩

[![Embodiments](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/919be470-810b-4974-8fe9-2784623aabd2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FV5ZYytkOQ)

**Prompt**

```
From this workstation scene, generate a robot-agnostic plan
expressed only in environment/affordance terms (no joint-space).
Assume it will be executed on ALOHA 2, Apptronik Apollo, or a Franka arm.
Return a step list with success checks and fallback options.
```

DeepMind highlights generalization across embodiments (e.g., ALOHA-2 → Apollo/Franka) to speed skill transfer. ([blog.google][3])

## Tips & patterns

* Prefer **normalized [y,x] in 0–1000** for points, or `[ymin,xmin,ymax,xmax]` for boxes. This keeps prompts model-friendly and implementation-agnostic. ([Google Developers Blog][1])
* Tune the **thinking budget** (latency/accuracy trade-off) depending on task complexity. ([Google Developers Blog][1])
* Interleave **text + points/boxes/trajectories** to produce “spatially grounded” plans your controller can execute. ([Google Developers Blog][1])
* Use **tool calls** (e.g., Search) to ground plans in local rules (recycling, kitchen policies, etc.). ([Google Developers Blog][1])
