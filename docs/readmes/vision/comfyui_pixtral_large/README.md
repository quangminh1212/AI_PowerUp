```
2. Restart ComfyUI

## Included Nodes

The extension adds three powerful nodes to ComfyUI:

### 1. Pixtral Large
Main node for image analysis using Pixtral Large.

Parameters:
- `prompt`: Your query about the image(s) - can be in any supported language
- `images`: Input images to analyze
- `api_key`: Your Mistral AI API key
- `temperature`: Response randomness (0.0-1.5)
- `maximum_tokens`: Max response length (1-32768)
- `top_p`: Nucleus sampling parameter (0.0-1.0)

Use Cases:
- Image analysis and description
- Document text extraction
- Chart and graph interpretation
- Mathematical reasoning
- Cross-lingual image understanding

### 2. Multi Images Input
Specialized node for combining multiple images into a batch for analysis.

Parameters:
- `inputcount`: Number of image inputs (2-30)
- Dynamic image inputs (generated based on inputcount)
- Optional parameters for each image slot

Features:
- Automatic batch creation
- Support for up to 30 simultaneous images
- Compatible with all ComfyUI image outputs
- Maintains image quality and resolution
- Efficient memory handling

Use Cases:
- Batch document processing

- Before/after image analysis

### 3. Preview Text
Advanced text output display node for viewing Pixtral Large results.

Parameters:
- `text`: Input text to display (automatically connected to Pixtral Large output)
- Dynamic sizing
- Auto-formatting

Features:
- RTL language support
- Unicode text display
- Formatted output
- Multi-paragraph handling
- Supports all languages
- Copy-paste functionality

Use Cases:
- Displaying analysis results
- Debugging outputs

- Intermediate result inspection
- Documentation generation

## Node Connections and Workflow Examples

### Basic Single Image Analysis
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Load Image] --> B[Pixtral Large]
    B --> C[Preview Text]
```

### Multi-Image Analysis
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Load Image 1] --> C[Multi Images Input]
    B[Load Image 2] --> C
    C --> D[Pixtral Large]
    D --> E[Preview Text]
```

### Complex Document Analysis
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Load Image 1] --> D[Multi Images Input]
    B[Load Image 2] --> D
    C[Load Image 3] --> D
    D --> E[Pixtral Large]
    E --> F[Preview Text]
```

## Multilingual Capabilities

Pixtral Large offers robust multilingual support for both input and output:

### Text Recognition (OCR)
- Recognizes text in multiple scripts and languages
- Particularly strong with:
  - Hebrew (עברית) - including modern and historical texts
  - Latin scripts
  - CJK characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
  - Arabic script
  - Cyrillic
  - And more

### Analysis and Response
- Can understand prompts in multiple languages
- Provides responses in the same language as the prompt
- Handles mixed-language content effectively
- Accurate translation and transcription capabilities

### Example Usage
```python
# Hebrew prompt example
prompt = "תאר את התמונה בעברית"

# Mixed language example
prompt = "Analyze this image and provide the response in Hebrew (עברית)"
```

## Getting the free API Key
1. Visit [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) and sign up or log into your account.
2. Navigate to the API section and follow the instructions to generate a new API key.
3. Once you have your API key, enter it into the node configuration as described in the setup instructions.

## Error Handling

Common error messages and solutions:

### Multi Images Input Errors
- "At least 2 images are required": Add more images to input slots
- "Exceeded maximum image count": Reduce number of input images to 30 or less
- "Invalid image format": Ensure images are in supported format

### Pixtral Large Errors
- "API Error": Verify API key and internet connection
- "Invalid prompt": Check prompt formatting
- "Token limit exceeded": Reduce maximum_tokens parameter

### Preview Text Errors
- "Unicode decode error": Check text encoding
- "Display buffer full": Reduce output size
