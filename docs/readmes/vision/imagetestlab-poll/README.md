## 🛠️ Architecture Highlights

This preview highlights three core pillars of full-stack engineering implemented in the project:

### 1. ⚡ Intelligent Performance Guard & WebGL Fallbacks
To ensure an immersive 60 FPS loading experience on low-end devices and slow mobile connections, a multi-tier client detection script runs prior to initializing WebGL:
* **Hardware Benchmarking**: Queries `navigator.deviceMemory` (RAM) and `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` (CPU cores) to identify low-spec hardware.
* **Network Latency Check**: Queries the Network Information API for connection speed indicators (`slow-2g`, `2g`, `3g`) or data-saving mode (`conn.saveData`).
* **Visual Adaptability**: If a bottleneck is detected, the application automatically bypasses the heavy 3D Spline WebGL scene (saving 1MB of JS overhead and CPU cycles) and displays a hardware-accelerated CSS space gradient fallback.

### 🔊 2. Real-Time Web Audio API Synthesis
Custom synthesized auditory feedback engineered directly inside the client browser without media asset latency:
* **Auditory Presets**: Multi-mode sound synthesis engine (`Default` chime, retro `8-Bit` square-wave sweeps, sci-fi `Laser` sawtooth zaps, filtered `Bubble` bandpass pops, and tactile `Mechanical` keyboard switches).
* **Binaural Ambience**: Generates real-time custom chords, panning melodies, and binaural beats directly within the browser AudioContext for relaxing research sessions.
* **Audio Debouncing**: Integrated audio call-stack throttling (60ms debounce window) to prevent overlapping click sounds from event propagation.

### 🛡️ 3. Safe Secrets & Cryptographic Verification
* **Secret Audit Utilities**: Real-time validation, rate limit tracking, and usage budget metrics.
* **Key Encryption Display**: Frontend key-masking logic that displays sensitive API credentials in an encrypted style representation to prevent shoulder-surfing.
