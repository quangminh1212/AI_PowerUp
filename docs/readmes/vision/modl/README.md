# modl-org/modl

Local-first AI image generation toolkit. Pull models, train LoRAs, generate images. One CLI, no glue code.

---

# modl

**Train LoRAs and generate images on your own GPU.** Web UI + CLI. Managed runtime. It just works.

![Two modl commands — train a LoRA from a folder of photos, then generate with it — above four images produced by modl: a portrait, a product shot, a steampunk owl, and a dog in space](docs/assets/hero.webp)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://modl.run/install.sh | sh
modl pull z-image-turbo
modl generate "a cat on mars"
```

## Why modl?

**No glue code.** One binary handles model downloads, dependency resolution, image generation, LoRA training, and output management. No separate tools to install, no configs to write.

**Smart model management.** Models are stored once in a content-addressed store. ComfyUI, A1111, and other tools see symlinks — no duplicate 24GB files.

**GPU-aware.** Automatically picks the right model variant (fp16, fp8, quantized) for your VRAM. A 4090 gets full quality. An 8GB card still works.

**Train LoRAs in one command.** Point it at a folder of images, pick a base model, and go. Powered by [ai-toolkit](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit) under the hood, with auto-captioning, dataset prep, and sensible defaults included.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://modl.run/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model (auto-selects variant for your GPU)
modl pull z-image-turbo

# Generate
modl generate "a photo of a mountain lake at sunset"
```

Or do everything at once:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://modl.run/install.sh | sh -s -- --quick
```

This installs modl, pulls a starter model, and launches the web UI.

### Other install methods

You can [inspect the install script](https://github.com/modl-org/modl/blob/main/install.sh) before running it, or skip it entirely:

```bash
# Download binary directly from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/modl-org/modl/releases
tar -xzf modl-*.tar.gz
sudo mv modl /usr/local/bin/

# Or build from source (Rust 1.85+, Python 3.11+)
git clone https://github.com/modl-org/modl.git
cd modl
cargo build --release
# Binary at target/release/modl
```

---

## Web UI

```bash
modl serve
```

Generate, train, browse outputs, and manage models from the browser at `http://localhost:3939`. Same engine as the CLI.

![modl web UI — generate tab](https://modl.run/ui-generate-lora.webp)

Install as a system service (starts on boot):

```bash
modl serve --install-service
```

---

## Train a LoRA

```bash
# Prepare dataset (auto-captions your images)
modl dataset create my-product --from ~/photos/product-shots/
modl dataset caption my-product

# Train
modl train --dataset my-product --base flux-dev --name product-v1 --lora-type object

# Generate with your LoRA
modl generate "a photo of OHWX on marble countertop" --lora product-v1
```

### No GPU? Rent one for the training run

`--pod` rents a GPU on [Vast.ai](https://cloud.vast.ai) with **your own API key**, trains there, syncs the LoRA back to your machine, and destroys the pod when done. No modl account, no hosted service — your key, your pod, your results.

```bash
export VASTAI_API_KEY=<your-key>   # from cloud.vast.ai/account (add an SSH key too)

modl train --dataset my-product --base flux2-dev --name product-v1 \
  --lora-type object --pod a100-80gb

modl pod ls          # anything still running (and billing)?
modl pod rm <id>     # destroy a straggler
```

Train 19B-class models (Flux 2 Dev, Qwen Image) on an A100/H100 for well under a dollar an hour — the trained LoRA lands in your local library like any local run.

### Generate on a pod too — your whole rig, rented by the hour

A persistent pod gets its own modl install and behaves like a remote copy of your machine: models are pulled into the pod's store (variant auto-selected for *its* GPU), workflows run entirely on the pod, and the images sync back when the run finishes.

```bash
modl pod up rtx4090 --model flux-schnell     # rent + set up + warm the store (~$0.35/hr)

modl generate "a red apple on a rustic wooden table" --base flux-schnell --pod
modl edit --image photo.png "make it golden" --pod
modl run workflow.yaml --pod                 # multi-step workflows, chained on the pod

modl generate "OHWX on a beach" --base flux-dev --lora product-v1 --pod   # your LoRA, their GPU
modl generate "a red apple" --base qwen-image --fast 4 --pod              # Lightning fast mode

modl pod rm <id>                             # destroy when done — pods bill until destroyed
```

Runs are fire-and-forget on the pod: close the laptop mid-generation and the job finishes anyway — fetch the results later with `modl pod pull <run-id>`. Everything moves directly between your machine and the pod over SSH; no cloud storage, no third-party relay. `modl run workflow.yaml --pod --dry-run` validates a workflow's pod-compatibility without renting anything.

LoRAs work on pods like they do locally: registry LoRAs are pulled on the pod, and your own trained LoRAs are pushed into the pod's store automatically the first time a workflow references them. This closes the loop with pod training — train on a pod, then `--lora <name>` on a pod, no manual file juggling.

Not yet supported on pods: controlnet/style-ref, inpainting masks.

## Image Primitives

### Generation & Editing

```bash
modl generate "prompt" --base flux-dev          # text to image
modl generate "prompt" --init-image photo.png   # image to image
modl generate "prompt" --init-image img --mask mask.png  # inpainting
modl edit "add sunglasses" --image portrait.png  # instruction editing
```

### ControlNet & Style Reference

```bash
modl preprocess canny photo.png                 # extract edges / depth / pose
modl generate "prompt" --controlnet edges.png   # structural control
modl generate "prompt" --style-ref painting.png # style transfer
```

### Vision-Language

```bash
modl ground "coffee cup" cafe.png               # find objects → bounding boxes
modl describe photo.png                         # generate captions
modl vl-tag photo.png                           # auto-tag images
```

### Analysis & Post-Processing

```bash
modl score photo.png                            # aesthetic quality (1-10)
modl detect photo.png                           # face detection
modl segment photo.png --bbox 120,340,280,500   # create masks (SAM)
modl face-restore photo.png                     # fix AI faces
modl upscale photo.png --scale 4                # 4x resolution
modl remove-bg photo.png                        # transparent PNG
modl compose --bg scene.png --layer subject.png # layer images onto canvas
modl compare ref.png target.png                 # CLIP similarity
```

Every command supports `--json` for scripting and agent pipelines.

## Already Have Models?

```bash
modl system link --comfyui ~/ComfyUI
modl system link --a1111 ~/stable-diffusion-webui
```

modl scans your model folders, hashes files, and moves recognized models into the store — replacing them with symlinks. Your tools keep working, nothing breaks.

---

## Storage Location

By default, models live in `~/modl/store/`. To put them on a bigger disk:

```bash
modl config storage.root /srv/disk2/modl-store
```

Existing models are not moved automatically — set this before pulling, or move the directory and update the config.

---

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/modl /usr/local/bin/python   # binary + bundled Python runtime
rm -rf ~/modl                                           # model store, configs, DB
```

If you set a custom `storage.root`, remove that path too.

---

## Docker

```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 3939:3939 -v modl-data:/workspace ghcr.io/modl-org/modl:latest
```

Set `MODEL=flux-schnell` to auto-pull a model on first boot. Models persist on the volume across restarts.

---

## Architecture

Single Rust binary for speed and distribution. Managed Python runtime for GPU compute. No external dependencies to install.

Full CLI reference: **[modl.run/docs](https://modl.run/docs)**

---

## Privacy & Network Access

modl sets `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` by default — the Python worker does not contact HuggingFace during normal use. Models are downloaded explicitly via `modl pull` and served from local storage.

Some vision models (Florence-2, BiRefNet) require `trust_remote_code` from HuggingFace transformers. This means model-specific Python code is downloaded from their HF repos on first use. These are well-known models from Microsoft and verified researchers, and the code is only fetched once and cached locally. Affected commands: `modl describe`, `modl vl-tag`, `modl segment`, `modl remove-bg`.
