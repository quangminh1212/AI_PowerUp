## 🌟 Overview

Gideon transforms your Discord server into an AI-powered hub, connecting members to state-of-the-art language and image models. With Gideon, users can have intelligent conversations, generate creative images, analyze visual content, manage URLs, play AI-powered trivia games, and organize discussions through an intuitive thread system.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Intelligence

* **Multiple AI Models** - Access OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and more through OpenRouter
* **Persistent Channel Memory** - Long-term, channel-specific memory that grows over time. When a channel goes quiet for a configurable period (default 24 hours), Gideon automatically summarizes the conversation and stores it as a memory entry. Future conversations in that channel are informed by all past summaries — injected into the AI's context on every message — so the bot never loses track of recurring topics, decisions, or channel history. Memories are channel-isolated: `#general` never bleeds into `#dev`. Configurable via the dashboard or per-channel overrides.
* **Native Tool Calling** - Simply @mention Gideon with natural language to automatically execute commands without needing to remember slash command syntax. The primary LLM model natively decides whether to call a tool or respond conversationally — no separate intent classification step needed:
  + **Reminders**: "@Gideon remind me to check the server logs tomorrow at 3pm"
  + **Image Generation**: "@Gideon draw a sunset over mountains with vibrant colors"
  + **Web Search**: "@Gideon what are the current best games on Xbox Game Pass"
  + **Calculations**: "@Gideon what's 15% of 250?"
  + **Translations**: "@Gideon translate 'hello world' to French"
  + **Definitions**: "@Gideon define serendipity"
  + **Polls**: "@Gideon create a poll: pizza vs burgers vs tacos"
  + **Timezone Conversion**: "@Gideon what's 3pm EST in Tokyo?"
  + **Unit Conversion**: "@Gideon convert 5 miles to kilometers"
  + **Dice Rolls**: "@Gideon roll 3d6"
  + **Events**: "@Gideon schedule a team meeting next Friday at 2pm"
  + **Multi-Tool**: "@Gideon calculate 15% of 250 and translate the result to French"
  + **Conversation**: Any other @mention automatically engages in natural conversation
* **Web Search** - Search the web for current information through conversational AI responses or natural language (@mention)
* **Image Generation** - Create stunning visuals using the unified `/dream` command or natural language @mentions. Supports multiple backend providers (AI Horde, Cloudflare Worker, OpenAI DALL-E, ComfyUI, OpenRouter). Admins can configure the active provider and its default settings.
* **Video Generation** - Generate AI videos with the `/video` command or directly from the dashboard, powered by OpenRouter's asynchronous video API. Supports multiple models (Veo 3.1, Sora 2 Pro, Seedance 2.0/1.5, Wan 2.7/2.6, Kling O1, etc.) with configurable duration, aspect ratio, resolution, audio, seed, and optional reference image (image-to-video).

### 🎭 Per-Channel Personas

Give Gideon a unique identity in every channel using Discord webhooks. Each persona can have its own display name, avatar, and system prompt — letting you tailor the bot's personality to different communities, topics, or server roles.

* **Custom Personas** — Set a unique name, avatar URL, and system prompt per channel
* **Built-in Templates** — Get started quickly with seeded templates: *Helpful Assistant*, *Tech Guru*, and *Creative Writer*
* **Template Inheritance** — Channel personas can reference templates without being locked to them; template updates don't overwrite existing configurations
* **Webhook-Powered** — Responses route through Discord webhooks so the persona appears as its own identity, not the bot account
* **Automatic Fallback** — If webhook creation fails (e.g., missing permissions), Gideon falls back to the bot account gracefully
* **Thread Support** — Personas inherit from parent channels in threads

**Commands**: `/persona set`, `/persona template`, `/persona view`, `/persona list`, `/persona toggle`, `/persona remove`, `/persona preview`, `/persona templates`

### 🎮 Entertainment

* **AI-Powered Trivia** - Play interactive trivia games with questions generated dynamically by AI
  + **Solo Mode**: Test your knowledge in a personal trivia session
  + **Competitive Mode**: Race against other players for the highest score
  + **Dynamic Categories**: Ask questions about ANY topic - the AI generates questions on-demand
  + **Smart Scoring**: Earn points based on difficulty, speed, and answer streaks
  + **Achievements**: Unlock badges for milestones like perfect games, speed records, and win streaks
  + **Leaderboards**: Compete on daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time rankings
  + **Natural Gameplay**: Just type your answer directly in the thread - no complex commands needed!

### 🧵 Organization

* **Conversation Threads** - Create dedicated topics with independent histories using Discord's native threads
* **Auto-Responses** - Bot automatically responds to all messages in AI threads
* **Dynamic URL Summarization** - Instantly extracts and distills key information from any shared webpage

### 🖥️ Admin Dashboard

* **Web-Based Management** - Full browser-based admin dashboard as an alternative to Discord slash commands
* **Real-Time Monitoring** - Live activity feed with WebSocket-powered updates
* **API Key Management** - Add, edit, validate, and delete API keys for all providers via the dashboard, with Fernet-encrypted database storage and full audit logging
* **Personas Tab** - Browse, create, edit, and apply channel personas and templates from the browser
* **Backup & Restore** - Export and import your configuration (JSON) or full database (SQLite) directly from the dashboard
* **Settings Management** - Edit global settings, channel overrides, session timeout, auto-summarize toggle, and tool calling from the browser
* **Thread & Channel Management** - View, edit, and delete threads and channel configurations
* **System Diagnostics** - Run diagnostics, check provider status, and trigger data pruning
* **Secure Authentication** - Token-based authentication with configurable secret key
* **Theme Support** - Dark and light mode toggle with persistent preference

### 💾 Backup & Restore

Protect your bot's configuration and data with a full backup and restore system, all accessible from the web dashboard.

* **Configuration Backups (JSON)** — Export all configuration tables; API keys and webhook credentials are excluded from exports for security, but webhook credentials are re-applied automatically on import
* **Full Database Backups (SQLite)** — Complete database snapshot using SQLite's online backup API
* **Pre-import Validation** — Multi-level validation (structure, required fields, schema version) before any data is applied
* **Transaction Safety** — Config imports are wrapped in database transactions to ensure atomicity
* **File Limits** — 10 MB for JSON config exports, 100 MB for full database backups

### 🛠️ Customization

* **Model Switching** - Change AI models on-the-fly with simple commands
* **Channel Personalities** - Set different system prompts per channel, or go further with full per-channel personas
* **Admin Controls** - Comprehensive configuration options for server admins

## 🚀 Installation

There are two ways to install and run Gideon: using Docker (recommended for ease of deployment and management) or directly with Python.

### Prerequisites

**For both methods:**

* Git installed
* Discord bot token with Message Content Intent enabled ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
* OpenRouter API key ([OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/))
* AI Horde API key (optional, for `/dream` command - [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net/register))
* Cloudflare Worker URL & API Key (optional, requires self-setup — see [Cloudflare Worker Configuration](#cloudflare-worker-configuration-optional))

**For Docker Installation:**

* Docker installed
* Docker Compose installed (usually included with Docker Desktop)

**For Python Installation:**

* Python 3.8+

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eoko-dev/gideon
   cd gideon
   ```

2. **Configure Environment:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and tokens
   ```

   Leave `DATA_DIRECTORY` blank or commented out when using Docker Compose — the volume mount handles data persistence.

3. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t gideon-bot:latest .
   ```

4. **Configure Docker Compose:**

   Open `docker-compose.yml` and verify the `volumes` section:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./gideon_data:/app/data
   ```

   Ensure the host path is writable by Docker.

5. **Run the Container:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose logs -f   # View logs
   docker-compose down      # Stop bot
   ```

### Python Installation

```bash
# Clone and enter repository
git clone https://github.com/eoko-dev/gideon
cd gideon

# Set up environment and dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure bot
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Discord token, API keys,
# and set DATA_DIRECTORY to an absolute path where the bot can write data.
# Example: DATA_DIRECTORY=/home/user/gideon_data

# Launch
python3 -m src
```

### Discord Configuration

1. Create an application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Under "Bot" tab:
   * Enable "Message Content Intent"
   * Copy your bot token for the `.env` file
3. Generate invite URL in "OAuth2 > URL Generator":
   * Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   * Permissions: Send Messages, Read Message History, Embed Links, Use Slash Commands, Manage Threads, **Manage Webhooks** (required for persona feature)

### Tool Calling Configuration (Optional)

Gideon's native tool calling feature allows users to interact naturally with the bot through @mentions instead of slash commands. The primary LLM model receives tool definitions and decides natively whether to call a tool or respond conversationally — no separate intent classification step needed. Enabled by default.

**Environment Variables:**

```env
TOOL_CALLING_ENABLED=TRUE
TOOL_CALLING_MAX_ITERATIONS=3
```

> **Backward Compatibility:** The legacy `INTENT_DISCOVERY=TRUE` env var still works as an alias for `TOOL_CALLING_ENABLED`. The old `INTENT_DETECTION_MODEL` and `INTENT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` vars are deprecated and no longer used.

**How It Works:**
When you @mention Gideon, the bot sends your message to the primary LLM model with tool definitions attached:

1. The model decides natively whether to call a tool or respond conversationally
2. If the model requests tool calls, each tool is executed and results are fed back
3. The model generates a final text response incorporating the tool results
4. If tool calling is disabled, falls back to plain conversation (no tools)

**Available Tools:** `set_reminder`, `generate_image`, `web_search`, `calculate`, `translate`, `define`, `create_poll`, `convert_timezone`, `convert_units`, `roll_dice`, `schedule_event`

**Key advantages over the old intent classification system:**
- Single LLM call instead of two (classification + response)
- No separate classification model or confidence threshold
- Supports multi-tool requests (e.g., "calculate 15% of 250 and translate the result to French")
- Uses full conversation context (the model sees chat history)

### Admin Dashboard Configuration (Optional)

Gideon includes a web-based admin dashboard that provides a browser interface for managing all bot settings, personas, backup/restore, channels, threads, and diagnostics.

**⚠️ WARNING: This feature is experimental and should NOT be exposed to the public internet without additional authentication measures in place.**

**Environment Variables:**

```env
DASHBOARD_ENABLED=TRUE
DASHBOARD_PORT=8080
DASHBOARD_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

**Quick Start:**

1. Generate a secret: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`
2. Add to `.env` and restart the bot
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
4. Log in with the dashboard secret

**Docker:** The dashboard port is automatically exposed via docker-compose.

**API Key Management (Optional):**

The dashboard supports encrypted API key storage in the database. To enable:

1. Generate an encryption key: `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`
2. Add to `.env`: `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=your_generated_key`
3. In the dashboard, go to the **API Keys** tab to manage keys

Keys stored in the database take priority over `.env` values. This is fully backward compatible — the bot works without `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` set.

**Dashboard Tabs:**

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Bot status, server count, message stats, uptime, latency, provider links |
| API Keys | Encrypted API key management with validation, import from `.env`, and audit logging |
| Settings | Edit global model, provider, system prompt, memory limits, session timeout, auto-summarize toggle, and tool calling |
| Channels | View and edit channel-specific configuration overrides (including per-channel memory settings) |
| Threads | Manage AI conversation threads (rename, configure, delete) |
| Messages | Browse stored conversation history with filtering and pagination |
| Memory | Browse and manage long-term channel memories; view summaries with conversation dates; clear memories or manually trigger summarization |
| Personas | Browse templates, configure per-channel personas, create custom templates |
| Backup & Restore | Export/import configuration JSON or full SQLite database backup |
| Diagnostics | System health checks, provider status, manual data pruning |
| Live Activity | Real-time WebSocket feed of bot events and message activity |

### Persona Configuration (Optional)

To use per-channel personas, the bot requires the **Manage Webhooks** permission in channels where personas are active. Without this permission, Gideon falls back to responding as the bot account.

Configure personas via the dashboard **Personas** tab or via slash commands:

```
/persona set display_name:TechBot system_prompt:You are a helpful tech support assistant.
/persona template helpful-assistant
/persona toggle
```

### Image Generation Provider Configuration (Optional)

Gideon's unified `/dream` command supports multiple backend providers.

**Cloudflare Worker (Optional)**

⚠️ Setting up and deploying the Cloudflare Worker is the responsibility of the end user. Gideon does not provide support for configuring or troubleshooting Cloudflare Workers.

```env
CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL=https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=your_api_key  # optional, if your worker requires auth
```

An example worker tested with Gideon: [flux1-cloudflare-worker](https://github.com/eoko-dev/flux1-cloudflare-worker)

**OpenAI DALL-E (Optional)**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

**ComfyUI (Optional)**

```env
COMFYUI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8188
```

Use `/dream_manage comfyui_test` to verify connectivity, `/dream_manage comfyui_workflow` to load a custom workflow JSON.

**OpenRouter (Optional)**

Uses the same key as chat. Activate with `/dream_manage set_provider provider:OpenRouter`.

### Video Generation Configuration (Optional)

Gideon's `/video` command uses OpenRouter's asynchronous video generation API. It reuses the existing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or a key stored in the dashboard's encrypted key store) — no extra configuration is required.

Available models include Veo 3.1, Veo 3, Sora 2 Pro, Seedance 2.0/1.5, Wan 2.7/2.6, and Kling Video O1. Configure defaults via the dashboard **Video Gen** tab or with `/video_manage configure`. Per-invocation overrides for `model`, `duration`, `aspect_ratio`, `resolution`, `audio`, `seed`, and `image_url` (image-to-video) are accepted directly on `/video`.

Generation typically takes 30 seconds to several minutes; the bot polls until the job reaches a terminal state and posts the result inline (or links to the unsigned URL when the file exceeds Discord's 25 MB attachment limit).

## ❓ Troubleshooting

* **Bot Offline/Unresponsive:**
  * **Python:** Check if the `python3 -m src` process is running. Check console logs for startup errors.
  * **Docker:** Check container status (`docker ps`). View logs with `docker-compose logs -f`.
  * Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env` is correct.
  * Ensure the bot has `Send Messages`, `Read History`, `Use Slash Commands`, and `Manage Threads` permissions.

* **Commands Not Working:**
  * Verify you have the required permissions (Admin for config/persona commands).
  * Check API keys in `.env` are correct for the features being used.
  * Check the bot's logs for specific error messages.

* **Personas Not Showing:**
  * Ensure the bot has **Manage Webhooks** permission in the channel.
  * Verify the persona is active via `/persona view` or the dashboard Personas tab.
  * Check logs for webhook creation errors.

* **Image Generation (`/dream`) Failures:**
  * Verify provider configuration (`/dream_manage view_config`) and API keys.
  * Ensure the bot has `Attach Files` and `Embed Links` permissions.
  * Check AI Horde status/kudos if using that provider.

* **Video Generation (`/video`) Failures:**
  * Confirm an OpenRouter API key is set (in `.env` or the dashboard's encrypted key store) and that the account has video generation credits.
  * If the bot reports `Timed out…`, the model is taking longer than the 15-minute polling cap — re-run with a shorter duration or smaller resolution.
  * If a job ends with status `failed`, run `/video_manage models` to verify the chosen model still exists, and check that the requested duration / aspect ratio / resolution combination is supported by that model.
  * Files larger than 25 MB cannot be attached directly; the bot will post the unsigned URL instead.

* **Database/State Issues:**
  * Ensure `DATA_DIRECTORY` (Python) or the Docker volume mount is correct and writable.
  * Check logs for SQLite errors (`database is locked`, `unable to open database file`).
  * Use the dashboard **Backup & Restore** tab to export a backup before troubleshooting.
