# Jchhhh/Analysis-of-embodied-end-effector-forms-based-on-LLM

This study proposes an end-to-end system combining LLMs and generative AI to convert natural language into 3D-printable robotic end-effector models. Through semantic parsing, image generation, and 3D reconstruction, it improves design efficiency, accuracy, and printability, enabling intelligent automated design.

# Analysis-of-embodied-end-effector-forms-based-on-LLM  

This study presents an end-to-end system that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative AI to transform natural language descriptions into 3D-printable robotic end-effector models. By combining semantic parsing, text-to-image generation, and 3D reconstruction, the system enhances design efficiency, geometric accuracy, and printability, enabling intelligent automated design for robotic applications.  


## Environment Configuration  

### Robosuite Setup  
```bash  
# Install robosuite with required dependencies  
pip install robosuite==1.4.0  
# Install PyTorch (CUDA-enabled version recommended)  
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  
# Clone and set up ComfyUI for generative workflows  
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git  
cd ComfyUI && pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### ComfyUI Model Path Configuration  
Define the root directory for model storage using an environment variable:  
```bash  
export COMFYUI_MODEL_PATH="/path/to/models"  # Directory containing all models  
```  


## Text-to-Image Workflow (Workflow 1)  

### Model Loading Configuration  
| Component            | Model Name                  | Storage Path                          | Description                          |  
|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| UNet Loader          | `flux_dev.safetensors`      | `$COMFYUI_MODEL_PATH/unet/`           | Core diffusion model for image generation |  
| Dual Clip Loader     | - `t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors`<br>- `clip_I_flux.safetensors` | `$COMFYUI_MODEL_PATH/clip/`           | Text and image encoders for feature extraction |  
| VAE Loader           | `ae.safetensors`            | `$COMFYUI_MODEL_PATH/vae/`            | Variational autoencoder for latent space mapping |  
| Power Lora Loader    | `Flux/Digital_Impressionist.safetensors` | `$COMFYUI_MODEL_PATH/lora/Flux/`      | Custom LoRA adapter (trained locally; see code repo for details) |  
| Upscaling Model      | `4x_foolhardy_Remacri.pth`  | `$COMFYUI_MODEL_PATH/upscalers/`      | Super-resolution model for high-fidelity images |  

### Workflow Steps  
1. **Text Encoding**: Input natural language descriptions via the dual Clip loader to generate semantic features.  
2. **Image Synthesis**: Use the UNet model with the LoRA adapter to generate initial 2D images from encoded features.  
3. **Resolution Enhancement**: Apply the upscaling model to refine images to target dimensions (e.g., 1024x1024).  


## 2D-to-3D Conversion Pipeline  

### Tripo Generate Model Node  
- **Model Version**: `v2.5–20250123`  
- **Usage**: Place the model file in `$COMFYUI_MODEL_PATH/tripo/` or specify the version in the ComfyUI node configuration to generate base 3D meshes from 2D images.  

### 3D Detail Optimization  
#### Tree-based Optimization Algorithm  
- **Purpose**: Hierarchical refinement of 3D meshes to improve geometric consistency and structural integrity.  
- **Key Parameters**:  
  - `optimization_iterations`: 50–100 (control detail complexity)  
  - `smoothness_weight`: 0.2–0.5 (balance between sharp edges and smooth surfaces)  

#### PyTorch-based Point Cloud Segmentation  
- **Input**: 3D point cloud coordinates from meshes.  
- **Output**: Semantic labels and optimization weights to refine surface details (e.g., edge sharpness, texture mapping).  
- **Training**: Fine-tune on custom datasets or use pre-trained models (e.g., ModelNet40) for transfer learning.  




## Running the System  

### 1. Start ComfyUI  
```bash  
python main.py --port 8188  # Access the web interface at http://localhost:8188  
```  

### 2. Import Workflows  
- Load pre-configured workflows (JSON files) into ComfyUI to automate the text→image→3D pipeline.  

### 3. Custom Model Training (Optional)  
For reproducing the LoRA adapter training (see `training_script.py` in the code repository):  
```bash  
python main.py --image-dir ./data/images --csv-path ./data/labelled_data.csv  
```
