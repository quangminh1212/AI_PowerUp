## Image → Point Cloud Reconstruction

Methods for reconstructing 3D point clouds from single or multiple static images, often estimating depth and camera intrinsics.

### UniK3D

*   **Task:** Single Image to Point Cloud (predicts depth & intrinsics)
*   [Website](https://lpiccinelli-eth.github.io/pub/unik3d/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16591) | [Code](https://github.com/lpiccinelli-eth/unik3d) | [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lpiccinelli/UniK3D-demo)

### MoGe

*   **Task:** Single Image to Point Cloud (Multi-modal Conditioned Generation)
*   [Website](https://wangrc.site/MoGePage/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19115) | [Code](https://github.com/microsoft/moge) | [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ruicheng/MoGe)

## Video → Point Cloud Reconstruction

Methods leveraging temporal information from video sequences for more robust 3D reconstruction or scene understanding.

### VGGT 

*   **Task:** Video to Point Cloud (predicts depth & intrinsics per frame)
*   [Website](https://vgg-t.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11651) | [Code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt) | [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/vggt)

### VGGSfM 

*   **Task:** Structure from Motion from Video
*   [Website](https://vggsfm.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04563) | [Code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggsfm) | [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/vggsfm)

### MegaSAM

*   **Task:** Video-based Scene Understanding / Segmentation (Related to reconstruction)
*   [Website](https://mega-sam.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04463) | [Code](https://github.com/mega-sam/mega-sam)

## Point Tracking

Methods for tracking the 3D or 2D motion of points or pixels over time in video sequences.

### Stereo 4D

*   **Task:** Dense 4D Scene Flow Estimation from Stereo Video
*   [Website](https://stereo4d.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09621) | [Code](https://github.com/Stereo4d/stereo4d-code)

### CoTracker3
