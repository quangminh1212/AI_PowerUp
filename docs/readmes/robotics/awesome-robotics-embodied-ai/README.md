# Manipulation & Grasping (VLA & Foundation Models & Policy & End-to-End)

## RT-1: Robotics Transformer for Real-World Control at Scale

- [Website](https://robotics-transformer1.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06817)
- by Google Robotics, 2022

An early large-scale transformer policy for real-world robot control. It showed that large, multi-task, language-conditioned robot policies can be trained on real robot datasets and generalize across many tabletop tasks. It is a bridge from classic imitation learning toward RT-2 / Open-X / OpenVLA style systems.

## ==RT-2: Vision-Language-Action Models: Transfer Web Knowledge to Robotic Control==

- [Website](https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/) | [Paper](https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/assets/rt2.pdf)
- by Google DeepMind, 2023

A canonical VLA paper. The key idea is to co-finetune a vision-language model on robot data, represent robot actions as tokens, and train on both web-scale VLM data and robotics data.

![rt2 overview](assets/rt2_overview.png)

Robot action becomes another “language”. Internet semantic knowledge can help robots, and VLM priors can transfer into robotic action. It showed emergent semantic behavior and improved performance on unseen tasks and objects. The training data couples the current image, the instruction, and the robot action at each timestep.

![rt2 robot action data](assets/rt2_robot_action_data.png)

Its center of gravity is semantic transfer from web-scale VLMs. That is different from later GEN-style claims centered on robotic physical interaction data. It is also different from RDT-style action-centric design, which cares more about continuous action structure and cross-robot action alignment. Tokenized actions are elegant, but continuous control quality and latency remain central challenges. The historical importance is larger than the current open reproducibility. The project connects RT-1 and PaLM-E and points toward Open-X Embodiment / RT-X.

## ==Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion==

- [Website](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04137) | [Code](https://github.com/real-stanford/diffusion_policy)
- by [Cheng Chi](https://cheng-chi.github.io) (Columbia) et al.
- RSS 2023

A key policy learning paper from the recent wave of robot learning. Robot action generation is modeled as a conditional denoising diffusion process.

## Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy

- [Website](https://octo-models.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12213) | [Code](https://github.com/octo-models/octo)
- by Dibya Ghosh (UC Berkeley) et al., 2024

An open-source generalist robot policy trained on heterogeneous robot data. It is designed to be adapted to new robots and tasks efficiently.

It functions as a community baseline with open weights, open training code, fine-tuning support, and practical starting points for researchers. Compared with OpenVLA, Octo feels more policy-centric. Compared with GEN, Octo is more open and reproducible, while GEN makes stronger scaling-law claims.

## OpenVLA: An Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Model

- [Website](https://openvla.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09246) | [Code](https://github.com/openvla/openvla) | [Model](https://huggingface.co/openvla/openvla-7b)
- by Moo Jin Kim (Stanford) et al., 2024

An open-source VLA project. It is a 7B open-source VLA pretrained on robot episodes from Open X-Embodiment. It offers open checkpoints, a PyTorch training pipeline, and fast adaptation via fine-tuning. It serves as an open VLA baseline.

## ==RDT-1B: a Diffusion Foundation Model for Bimanual Manipulation==

- [Website](https://rdt-robotics.github.io/rdt-robotics/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07864) | [Code](https://github.com/thu-ml/RoboticsDiffusionTransformer) | [Model](https://huggingface.co/robotics-diffusion-transformer/rdt-1b)
- by [Songming Liu](https://csuastt.github.io) (Tsinghua University) et al., 2024

![alt text](assets/rdt_head.png)

An action-centric robot foundation model paper. Officially, it is a 1.2B-parameter diffusion transformer pretrained on 46 datasets with 1M+ episodes and fine-tuned on 6K+ self-collected ALOHA bimanual episodes.

![alt text](assets/rdt_framework.png)

It focuses on bimanual manipulation, which is substantially harder than many single-arm settings. It takes the continuous action problem seriously, treats multimodal action generation as first-class, and explicitly targets bimanual dexterity and embodiment heterogeneity. It introduces a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space.

A unified action space gives a route to cross-robot pretraining, transferable manipulation knowledge, and larger shared action datasets. It is especially relevant for dexterous manipulation, bimanual coordination, cross-embodiment action learning, and real robot fine-tuning after large-scale pretraining. It feels closer to a robotics-native action foundation model than a VLM adapted to robotics.

Compared with RT-2 and many VLA works, it starts from robot action, embodiment, and multimodality itself. The public ecosystem is improving, but it is still less convenient than openpi or OpenVLA as a full end-to-end community stack.

## RDT2: Exploring the Scaling Limit of UMI Data Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Embodiment Generalization

- [Website](https://rdt-robotics.github.io/rdt2/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03310) | [Model](https://huggingface.co/robotics-diffusion-transformer/RDT2-VQ)
- by Songming Liu (Tsinghua University) et al., 2026

A major evolution from RDT-1B. It shifts toward zero-shot cross-embodiment transfer, larger-scale data collection, UMI, and VLA-like structure on top of action modeling.

The project page emphasizes 10,000+ hours of data, 100+ indoor scenes, a 7B VLA backbone, Residual VQ action tokenization, and pretraining from Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct. It merges action-centric robot foundation model thinking from RDT with modern VLA / language-conditioned model design. Data interface design may be as important as model design in embodied AI. In robotics, the collection interface is not just tooling; it can define what kind of scaling becomes possible.

## ==π₀: Our First Generalist Policy==

- [Website](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0) | [Paper](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/download/pi0.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)
- by Karol Hausman (Physical Intelligence) et al., 2024

A robot foundation model built from a pretrained VLM backbone plus a continuous action expert with flow matching for low-level action generation. The goal is a generalist robot policy.

It combines web-scale semantic knowledge, large-scale robot data, continuous low-level motor output, and multi-robot generality. The project emphasizes pretraining on 10,000+ hours of robot data, multiple embodiments, and fine-tuning to dexterous real-world tasks such as folding laundry, clearing tables, putting dishes in microwaves, assembling boxes, and bagging groceries.

Compared with RT-2, it treats low-level action generation as a continuous generative modeling problem. Compared with RDT, it is more clearly built as a VLM-derived VLA foundation model. It is a strong example of combining multimodal pretraining semantics with continuous action generation.

## π₀.₅: a VLA with Open-World Generalization

- [Website](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi05) | [Paper](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi05) | [Code](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)
- by Ted Xiao (Physical Intelligence) et al., 2025

It pushes beyond familiar setups toward generalization in new homes and new environments. Its main principle is co-training on heterogeneous data.

The training mixture includes robot action data, high-level semantic robot examples, cross-embodiment data, multimodal web data, object detection, and verbal instruction demonstrations. It tries to teach the model not only how to move, but also what the task means, which objects matter, and what subtask should come next.

It uses discrete decoding for high-level semantic actions and continuous flow-matching decoding for low-level motor commands. The model effectively predicts the next subtask before emitting motor control. It is a strong statement that open-world robot generalization requires heterogeneous supervision, not just more demos of the same task. Generalization is a meaningful step, not a solved problem.

## openpi

- [Website](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/openpi) | [Code](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)
- by Physical Intelligence, 2025

A practical repo in embodied AI. It includes pi0, pi0-FAST, pi0.5, checkpoints, inference examples, a fine-tuning pipeline, remote policy serving, and JAX plus later PyTorch support.

It is a serious research and development stack with configs, data conversion, normalization stats, a policy server, and examples for DROID / ALOHA / LIBERO / UR5. It is unusually useful for replication and adaptation. It feels like a real usable research platform instead of a paper artifact.

## ==GEN-0: Embodied Foundation Models That Scale with Physical Interaction==

- [Website](https://generalistai.com/blog/nov-04-2025-GEN-0)
- by Generalist AI, 2025

A high-profile embodied AI announcement whose main significance is the public scaling-law claim.

Robotics is described as entering a scaling-law regime, with real physical interaction data as the key fuel. It argues that there is an intelligence threshold in model scale and that embodied foundation models can be trained directly on high-fidelity raw physical interaction.

Highlighted ideas include Harmonic Reasoning, Cross-Embodiment, 270,000+ hours of real-world manipulation data, a 7B+ phase transition or intelligence threshold, and downstream gains that follow power-law-like scaling. It tries to redefine the field around large-scale physical pretraining.

If that line holds, the center of gravity shifts from benchmark tricks, isolated tasks, and architecture-only novelty toward data engines, scale, embodiment-agnostic pretraining, and post-training efficiency. The announcement attracted attention because it sounds like a robotics analogue of the early GPT scaling moment.

It should currently be treated as a frontier closed research statement rather than an open reproducible baseline. Public information is still much thinner than openpi / OpenVLA / GR00T.

## ==GEN-1: Scaling Embodied Foundation Models to Mastery==

- [Website](https://generalistai.com/blog/apr-02-2026-GEN-1)
- by Generalist AI, 2026

It moves the story from scaling exists to scaled embodied models approaching economically meaningful usefulness. Publicly emphasized themes include reliability, speed, improvisation / recovery, and a much larger data engine, reportedly now over 500,000 hours.

Many robot demos fail because success rate is too low, execution is too slow, or recovery is too weak. The public story directly targets those issues. If GEN-0 is the scaling-law declaration, GEN-1 is the commercial or deployment threshold declaration.

The field has many strong demos but fewer signs of robust repetition, useful speed, and spontaneous recovery in messy edge cases. The public narrative is about those missing ingredients. It still lacks the same full technical transparency as openpi / Octo / OpenVLA / GR00T. It should be treated as very important and high-signal, but still much less independently reproducible.

# Planning & Reasoning (Agent & modular systems)

## ==SayCan: Do As I Can, Not As I Say: Grounding Language in Robotic Affordances==

- [Website](https://say-can.github.io) | [Paper](https://say-can.github.io/assets/palm_saycan.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/saycan)
- by Michael Ahn / Google, 2022

An early “LLM for robot task planning” work. It combines language-model probability with a value function or affordance score, then selects a skill to execute.

![saycan decision making](assets/saycan_decision_making.png)

The split between semantic usefulness and physical feasibility is the key template here. A skill should be both useful and possible.
