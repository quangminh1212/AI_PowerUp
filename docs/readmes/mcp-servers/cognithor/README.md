> **Pre-v1.0 Beta** — Cognithor is under active development. APIs may change between releases. Not recommended for production customer-facing deployments. Bug reports and feedback welcome via [Issues](../../issues).
>
> While the test suite is extensive (17,000+ test functions, 89% coverage gate), the project has not been battle-tested in production environments. Expect rough edges, breaking changes between versions, and some German-language strings in system prompts and error messages. See [Status & Maturity](#status--maturity) for details. For non-technical users, wait until version 1.0.0 for stable long-term support.

> **Vibe-Engineered, not vibe-coded.** Cognithor is not a weekend hack held together by AI-generated spaghetti. Every module follows a deliberate architecture (PGE-Trinity, 6-phase gateway init, 3-layer security, TRUST-1..10 operational-trust stack), backed by 17,000+ test functions, structured plans, spec compliance reviews, and code quality gates. The AI writes the code — but a human engineers the system. There's a difference.

## Why Cognithor?

Most AI assistants send your data to the cloud. Cognithor runs entirely on your machine — with Ollama or LM Studio, no API keys required. Cloud providers are optional, not mandatory.

It replaces a patchwork of tools with one integrated system: 17 channels, 141 MCP tools across 30 modules, 6-tier memory with 4-channel hybrid search, knowledge vault, voice, browser automation, Computer Use, cross-platform social listening, signed audit receipts (TRUST-1..10), resumable batch workflows (CRWE), TUF-Light-signed pack registry, and more — all wired together from day one. The test suite is extensive (17,000+ test functions, 89% coverage gate). See [Status & Maturity](#status--maturity) for what that does and does not guarantee.

**In plain terms:** Cognithor is an AI assistant that lives entirely on your computer. You talk to it through your terminal, a web UI, Telegram, Discord, or any of 18 supported channels — and it talks back, remembers what you said last week, and acts on your behalf. It can search the web, write and edit files, run shell commands, control your browser, automate your desktop (clicking, typing, reading windows), manage your calendar, and learn new skills over time. Think of it as a local, private, self-improving Jarvis.

Unlike cloud-based assistants, Cognithor keeps all your data on your machine. Your conversations, memories, documents, and credentials never leave your hardware unless you explicitly configure a cloud LLM provider. It works fully offline with Ollama or LM Studio, and it encrypts everything at rest with SQLCipher (AES-256). If privacy matters to you — and it should — this is the architecture you want.

What makes it different from other local AI tools is that Cognithor is not just a chatbot. It is an agent operating system: it plans multi-step tasks, evaluates its own results, learns from mistakes, and improves autonomously. It can control your desktop through Computer Use (screenshots, clicks, keystrokes, window automation), compete in ARC-AGI-3 reasoning benchmarks, and manage a marketplace of community-contributed skills. It is built to grow with you.

**What the test suite does NOT cover:** Real-world deployment scenarios, network edge cases, long-running stability, multi-user load, hardware-specific voice/GPU issues, or actual LLM response quality.

**Important notes for users:**
- This project is developed by a solo developer with AI assistance. Code is human-reviewed, but the pace is fast.
- Breaking changes may occur between minor versions. Pin your version if stability matters.
- The default language is **German**, switchable to **English** via the Flutter Command Center or `config.yaml`. See [Language & Internationalization](#language--internationalization).
- For production use, thorough testing in your specific environment is strongly recommended.
- Bug reports and contributions are welcome — see [Issues](https://github.com/Alex8791-cyber/cognithor/issues).

## Highlights

- **19 LLM Providers** — Ollama (local), LM Studio (local), vLLM (local), llama-cpp-python (local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, Together AI, OpenRouter, xAI (Grok), Cerebras, GitHub Models, AWS Bedrock, Hugging Face, Moonshot/Kimi, Claude Code — plus any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **17 Communication Channels** — CLI, Web UI, REST API, Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, Matrix, Google Chat, Mattermost, Feishu/Lark, IRC, Twitch, Voice (STT/TTS)
- **6-Tier Cognitive Memory** — Core identity, episodic logs, semantic knowledge graph, procedural skills, working memory, tactical memory
- **4-Channel Hybrid Search** — BM25 full-text + vector embeddings + knowledge graph traversal + hierarchical document reasoning with score fusion
- **PGE Architecture** — Planner (LLM) -> Gatekeeper (deterministic policy engine) -> Executor (sandboxed)
- **Crew-Layer (v0.93.0)** — high-level Multi-Agent API (`from cognithor import Crew, CrewAgent, CrewTask`) on top of PGE-Trinity. Async kickoff with parallel fan-out, idempotent replay, guardrails, 5 templates (research, customer-support, data-analyst, content, versicherungs-vergleich).
- **8-page Quickstart** — [`docs/quickstart/`](docs/quickstart/) — from `pip install` to your first Crew in under 10 minutes, bilingual (DE primary + EN). Includes runnable examples for first-crew, first-tool, first-skill, guardrails, and PKV report.
- **Security** — Platform-adaptive sandbox (bubblewrap on Linux, subprocess+timeout fallback), AST-based Python/Shell code analysis (Python `ast.NodeVisitor` + `bashlex` parser), SHA-256 audit chain, credential vault, runtime token encryption (Fernet AES-256), Gatekeeper policy engine with GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED risk classification (not independently audited — see [Status & Maturity](#status--maturity))
- **Knowledge Vault** — Obsidian-compatible Markdown vault with YAML frontmatter, tags, `[[backlinks]]`, full-text search
- **Document Analysis** — LLM-powered structured analysis of PDF/DOCX/HTML (summary, risks, action items, decisions)
- **Video Input** — Attach local videos (`.mp4` / `.webm` / `.mov` / `.mkv` / `.avi`) or paste direct video URLs; Qwen3.6-27B (or any video-capable VLM) analyzes them end-to-end via vLLM's native `video_url` content type. Adaptive frame sampling (fps=3 for short clips, `num_frames=32` for long) via `ffprobe`. Single video per turn, served from a 127.0.0.1-only HTTP file server, 24h auto-cleanup. Requires vLLM backend — Windows installer bundles LGPL ffmpeg. See [`docs/vllm-user-guide.md`](docs/vllm-user-guide.md).
- **VLM Router** — Three-tier profile system (`fast` / `balanced` / `premium`) for video and image understanding. Heuristic classifier inspects the user's prompt and clip metadata, picks the right VLM (Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct → Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking → Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4), exposes the routing decision via TRUST-2 (`rule_id` + `matched_pattern`) so a receipt reviewer can replay why a particular model was chosen. Override via `with router.quality_scope("premium"):` or `config.vllm.quality_default`. ContextVar-isolated for async safety. See [`src/cognithor/core/vlm_router.py`](src/cognithor/core/vlm_router.py).
- **Video Composition & Rendering** — Cognithor doesn't only *read* videos, it can *make* them. The `cognithor.video` package ships a thin `RendererABC` abstraction with **HyperFrames (Apache-2.0)** as the default backend; future renderers (Remotion, cloud) can be swapped without touching the MCP-tool layer. Five MCP tools cover the workflow: `video_compose` (GREEN — pure-function, builds a self-contained HTML composition from a structured spec, no subprocess, no FS write), `video_compose_explainer` (16:9 title-card + body + CTA preset), `video_compose_social_cut` (vertical 9:16 hook + fast-cut beats + outro), `video_caption_overlay` (parallel caption track), and `video_render` (ORANGE — renders composition HTML to MP4 / MOV / WebM under `~/.cognithor/render/<run_id>/`). Raw user-supplied HTML is **RED** at the Gatekeeper — only structured specs reach the renderer. Render output is linked to the agent run via the same `run_id` the streaming EventEmitter and TRUST-1 receipt API use, so every frame is provenance-attributable end-to-end. Composer prompts + reusable templates live in `cognithor.video.skills` (HF-5). VLM video-read can drive composition directly — see VLM-4 smoke at [`tests/test_video/`](tests/test_video/).
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — 141 tools across 30 modules (filesystem, shell, memory, web, browser, media, vault, synthesis, code, skills, documents, social, kanban, identity, evolution, computer-use, sevDesk, A2A and more) — counts auto-generated into [`docs/integrations/catalog.json`](docs/integrations/catalog.json) on every release
- **Computer Use** — Complete desktop automation: screenshots, clicking, typing, scrolling, dragging, Windows UI Automation via pywinauto for exact element coordinates, 3-layer security, adaptive wait
- **ARC-AGI-3 Benchmark Agent** — Compete in ARC Prize 2026: 13/25 games solved (24 levels), 4 solver families (ClusterClick, SequenceClick+SimA*, KeyboardDFS, SmartExplorer), persistent game profiles, multimodal vision (qwen3-vl)

### PGE Trinity (Planner -> Gatekeeper -> Executor)

Every user request passes through three stages:

1. **Planner** — LLM-based understanding and planning. Analyzes the request, searches memory for relevant context, creates structured action plans with tool calls. Supports re-planning on failures.
2. **Gatekeeper** — Deterministic policy engine. Validates every planned tool call against security rules (risk levels GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED, sandbox policy, parameter validation). No LLM, no hallucinations, no exceptions.
3. **Executor** — Executes approved actions via DAG-based parallel scheduling (independent actions run concurrently in waves). Shell commands run isolated (Process -> Namespace -> Container), file access restricted to allowed paths.

### 6-Tier Cognitive Memory

| Tier | Name | Persistence | Purpose |
|------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **Core** | `CORE.md` | Identity, rules, personality |
| 2 | **Episodic** | Daily log files | What happened today/yesterday |
| 3 | **Semantic** | Knowledge graph + SQLite | Customers, products, facts, relations |
| 4 | **Procedural** | Markdown + frontmatter | Learned skills and workflows |
| 5 | **Working** | RAM (volatile) | Active session context |
| 6 | **Tactical** | SQLite | Active goals, pending actions, rollback |

Memory search uses a 4-channel hybrid approach: **BM25** (full-text search with FTS5, optimized for German compound words) + **Vector Search** (Ollama embeddings, cosine similarity) + **Graph Traversal** (entity relations) + **Hierarchical Document Reasoning** (tree-based section navigation for long documents). Score fusion with configurable weights and recency decay.

### Knowledge Vault

In addition to the 6-tier memory, Cognithor includes an **Obsidian-compatible Knowledge Vault** (`~/.cognithor/vault/`) for persistent, human-readable notes:

- **Folder structure**: `recherchen/`, `meetings/`, `wissen/`, `projekte/`, `daily/`
- **Obsidian format**: YAML frontmatter (title, tags, sources, dates), `[[backlinks]]`
- **6 tools**: `vault_save`, `vault_search`, `vault_list`, `vault_read`, `vault_update`, `vault_link`

### Reflection & Procedural Learning

After completed sessions, the Reflector evaluates results, extracts facts for semantic memory, and identifies repeatable patterns as procedure candidates. Learned procedures are automatically suggested for future similar requests.

### Computer Use Pipeline

```
User Goal → CUTaskDecomposer → Sub-Tasks
  → UIA (exact coords) / Vision (fallback)
  → 3-Layer Tool Enforcement
  → Adaptive Wait → Next Iteration
```

Cognithor can control your desktop like a human: take screenshots, analyze them with a vision model, click at pixel coordinates, type text, scroll, and drag. Phase 3 adds Windows UI Automation via pywinauto, which reads the OS accessibility tree to get exact element coordinates without relying on vision alone. A 3-layer security model (allowlist + gatekeeper + tool enforcer) ensures destructive operations require explicit approval.

### Architecture Decision Records

  — Why Cognithor uses Planner/Gatekeeper/Executor instead of conversational
  GroupChat patterns.

## LLM Providers

Cognithor auto-detects your backend from API keys. Set one key and models are configured automatically:

| Provider | Backend Type | Config Key | Models (Planner / Executor) |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------------------------|
| **Ollama** (local) | `ollama` | *(none needed)* | qwen3:32b / qwen3:8b |
| **LM Studio** (local) | `lmstudio` | *(none needed)* | *(your loaded models)* |
| **vLLM** (local, NVIDIA GPU) | `vllm` | *(none needed)* | qwen3.6:27b NVFP4 (RTX 5090 / 32 GB VRAM target) |
| **llama-cpp-python** (local) | `llama_cpp` | `llama_cpp_base_url` | *(GGUF model loaded by llama.cpp server)* |

| **Moonshot/Kimi** | `moonshot` | `moonshot_api_key` | kimi-k2.5 / kimi-k2-turbo |
| **Claude Code** | `claude-code` | *(uses Claude Code CLI)* | *(Claude Code model)* |

```yaml
# ~/.cognithor/config.yaml — just set one key, everything else is auto-configured
gemini_api_key: "AIza..."
# That's it. Backend, models, and operation mode are auto-detected.

# Or use LM Studio (local, no API key needed):
llm_backend_type: "lmstudio"
# lmstudio_base_url: "http://localhost:1234/v1"  # default
```

## Quick Start

**Under 5 minutes from download to running agent.**

### Option A: Windows Installer (recommended for Windows users)

1. **Download** `CognithorSetup-{version}.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Alex8791-cyber/cognithor/releases/latest)
2. **Run the installer** — it bundles Python, Ollama, Flutter UI, and all dependencies
3. **Launch** via Desktop shortcut or Start Menu
4. **Done** — browser opens at `http://localhost:8741`

> The installer auto-detects your GPU, downloads the right models, and runs a health check. No prerequisites needed.

### Option B: Linux / macOS / Source Install

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Alex8791-cyber/cognithor.git
cd cognithor

# Linux/macOS: Interactive installer (venv, Ollama, models, systemd)
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

# Windows (from source): Double-click install.bat

# Or manual: pip install
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
```

### Option C: PyPI (any platform)

```bash
pip install cognithor               # Core only: PGE, CLI, Ollama
pip install cognithor[telegram]     # + Telegram channel
pip install cognithor[web]          # + Web UI (Flutter Command Center)
pip install cognithor[all]          # Everything (large install)
ollama pull qwen3:8b                # Pull a model
cognithor                           # Start

# Upgrade to a specific version:
pip install cognithor[all]==0.99.0

# Upgrade to latest:
pip install --upgrade cognithor[all]
```

### Prerequisites (Option B/C only)

- Python >= 3.12
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) (local, free) **or** any cloud LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)

### After Installation: Pull Models

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:32b              # Planner (20 GB VRAM)
ollama pull qwen3:8b               # Executor (6 GB VRAM)
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b   # Embeddings (500 MB VRAM)
```

No GPU? Use `qwen3:8b` for both, or set a cloud API key — models are auto-configured.

> **Uninstall:** Windows: run `uninstall.bat`. Linux: `./install.sh --uninstall`. PyPI: `pip uninstall cognithor`.

### Start (~10 sec)

**Option A: One-Click (Windows)** — includes a pre-built Web UI, no Node.js needed

```
Double-click  start_cognithor.bat  ->  Browser opens  ->  Click "Power On"  ->  Done.
```

> The launcher auto-installs Python and Ollama via winget if missing. Node.js is only needed for UI development (`npm run dev`).

**Option B: CLI**

```bash
cognithor                          # Interactive CLI
python -m cognithor                   # Same thing (always works, no PATH needed)

python -m cognithor --lite            # Lite mode: qwen3:8b only (6 GB VRAM)
python -m cognithor --no-cli          # Headless mode (API only)
COGNITHOR_HOME=~/my-cognithor cognithor  # Custom home directory
```

> **Windows:** If `cognithor` is not recognized after `pip install`, use `python -m cognithor` instead — this always works regardless of PATH configuration. Alternatively, add Python's `Scripts` directory to your PATH (typically `%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\Scripts` or the `Scripts` folder inside your venv).

**Option C: Flutter Command Center (Development)**

```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get
flutter run       # Desktop, or:
flutter run -d chrome  # Web
```

The Flutter Command Center connects to the Python backend on port 8741. Start the backend first (`python -m cognithor --no-cli`), then launch the Flutter app. The **Chat page** opens as the default start page — start talking to Cognithor immediately, or activate **Voice Mode** for hands-free conversation. The Sci-Fi aesthetic features dark translucent panels, neon accents, and GEPA pipeline visualization.

All configuration — agents, prompts, cron jobs, MCP servers, A2A settings — can be edited and saved through the dashboard. Changes persist to YAML files under `~/.cognithor/`.

> **Legacy React UI (deprecated):** The old React + Vite UI in `ui/` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the Flutter Command Center instead.

> **Windows users:** A desktop shortcut named **Cognithor** is included for convenience.

### Channel Auto-Detection

Channels start automatically when their tokens are found in `~/.cognithor/.env`:

```bash
# ~/.cognithor/.env — just add your tokens, channels activate automatically
COGNITHOR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-bot-token
COGNITHOR_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789
COGNITHOR_DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token
COGNITHOR_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-token
```

No need to set `telegram_enabled: true` in the config — the presence of the token is sufficient.

## Security

Cognithor implements multi-layered security (not independently audited):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Gatekeeper** | Deterministic policy engine (no LLM). 4 risk levels: GREEN (auto) -> YELLOW (inform) -> ORANGE (approve) -> RED (block) |
| **Sandbox** | 4 isolation levels: Process -> Linux Namespaces (nsjail) -> Docker -> Windows Job Objects |
| **Audit Trail** | Append-only JSONL with SHA-256 chain. Tamper-evident. Credentials masked before logging |
| **Credential Vault** | Fernet-encrypted, per-agent secret storage |
| **Runtime Token Encryption** | All channel tokens (Telegram, Discord, Slack, ...) encrypted in memory with ephemeral Fernet keys (AES-256). Never stored as plaintext in RAM |
| **TLS Support** | Optional SSL/TLS for all webhook servers (Teams, WhatsApp, API, WebUI). Minimum TLS 1.2 enforced. Warning logged for non-localhost without TLS |
| **File-Size Limits** | Upload/processing limits on all paths: 50 MB documents, 100 MB audio, 1 MB code execution, 50 MB WebUI uploads |
| **Session Persistence** | Channel-to-session mappings stored in SQLite (WAL mode). Survives restarts — no lost Telegram/Discord sessions |
| **Input Sanitization** | Injection protection for shell commands and file paths |
| **Sub-Agent Depth Guard** | Configurable `max_sub_agent_depth` (default 3) prevents infinite handle_message() recursion |
| **SSRF Protection** | Private IP blocking for http_request and web_fetch tools |
| **EU AI Act** | Compliance module, impact assessments, transparency reports |
| **Red-Teaming** | Automated offensive security tests (1,425 LOC) |

### GDPR Compliance (Privacy by Design) — 100% User Rights

Cognithor implements GDPR compliance at the architecture level with full coverage of all user rights:

- **Consent Management** — Per-channel consent with versioning. No data processing without explicit consent.
- **ComplianceEngine** — Runtime enforcement gate. Fail-closed design: blocks processing if consent store unavailable.
- **Art. 15 (Access)** — Complete export across 11 data tiers (sessions, vault, entities, relations, episodes, procedures, core memory, preferences, processing logs, model usage, consents). JSON + CSV formats.
- **Art. 16 (Rectification)** — `PATCH /api/v1/user/data` for entities, preferences, vault notes.
- **Art. 17 (Erasure)** — `DELETE /api/v1/user/data` with 7 erasure handlers covering all data tiers including vault notes.
- **Art. 18/21 (Restriction)** — Per-purpose restriction (evolution, cloud_llm, memory, osint) via REST API + ComplianceEngine enforcement.
- **Art. 20 (Portability)** — Export format v2.0 `cognithor_portable` + `POST /api/v1/user/data/import`.
- **Encryption at Rest** — SQLCipher (AES-256) for all 33 SQLite databases, Fernet for memory files, OS Keyring key management.
- **Audit Trail** — Append-only, SHA-256-chained compliance log with tamper detection.
- **TTL Enforcement** — Automated daily retention enforcement via cron.
- **Privacy Mode** — Runtime toggle disabling all persistent storage.
- **Processing Register** — Art. 30 compliant register of all 13 processing activities.

## Operational Trust (TRUST-1..10)

Since v0.97.0, every audit-relevant decision the agent makes is captured as a
structured, queryable, signed receipt rather than a free-form log string. The
canonical reference is [`docs/operational_trust.md`](docs/operational_trust.md).

### Receipt CLI

```bash
cognithor receipt show <run_id> --include-trust --sign-key $KEY      # full bundle
cognithor receipt verify path/to/bundle.json --sign-key $KEY         # round-trip check
cognithor receipt list --since 2026-05-01                            # enumerate run-ids
cognithor receipt export-all --since 2026-05-01 --out ./bundles/     # batch export
cognithor receipt diff bundle-A.json bundle-B.json                   # structural diff
```

The same bundle is also reachable via REST (owner-token gated):

```bash
curl -H "X-Cognithor-User: $COGNITHOR_OWNER_USER_ID" \
  "http://localhost:8741/api/crew/trace/<trace_id>/receipt?include_trust=true"
```

### Trust Ledgers

| Tier | Module | What it captures |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **TRUST-1** | `cognithor.audit.AuditLogger.run_receipt()` | Deterministic per-run JSON bundle; optional HMAC-SHA-256 signature |
| **TRUST-2** | `DecisionExplanation` (in `core/gatekeeper.py`) | `rule_id`, `rule_source`, `matched_pattern` for every block decision (12 sites) |
| **TRUST-3** | `FailureMode` (15 values) + `failure_mode_summary()` | Canonical taxonomy across runs |
| **TRUST-4** | `cognithor pack rollback` | Restores a pack to a prior cached version; seals into audit chain |
| **TRUST-5** | `cognithor.memory.provenance.ProvenanceLedger` | 9 memory-tier capture sites; `source_type` + `source_id` + `expiry_policy` |
| **TRUST-6** | `cognithor.security.permission_scope.ScopeRegistry` | Least-privilege per axis (filesystem / network / llm / tool) |
| **TRUST-7** | `cognithor.security.fingerprint.FingerprintLedger` | 4 of 5 kinds: `TOOL`, `PACK`, `MODEL`, `SCHEMA` (`BINARY` feature-flagged) |
| **TRUST-8** | `cognithor.security.cloud_escalation` | Metadata-only: ledger never stores prompt or response payloads |
| **TRUST-9** | `cognithor.security.cost_ledger.CostEntry` | Integer micro-USD canonical unit (no float rounding drift) |
| **TRUST-10** | `cognithor.security.migration_ledger` | Per-domain chain integrity; corruption in one domain doesn't poison others |

All six TRUST-5..10 ledgers are append-only frozen-dataclass + `StrEnum` +
JSON-serialisable. Capture is best-effort (`contextlib.suppress(Exception)`),
so a ledger fault cannot brick the calling tier. The composer
`cognithor.security.trust_bundle.build_trust_bundle(run_id)` folds all six
into a single canonical block under `bundle["trust"]`.

> **Status:** in-memory persistence only this release. Disk persistence
> (SQLCipher) + retention windows + TRUST-7 `BINARY` capture + TRUST-8
> backend-dispatch wiring + a Flutter `TrustBundlePanel` ship in 0.98.x.
> See [Sprint-27 IDE-Integration plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-04-sprint27-ide-integration.md)
> for the consuming-extension roadmap.

### Registry Trust Model (PACK-4)

The community-skill marketplace uses a self-managed Ed25519 + TUF-Light
signing scheme — **no third-party witness, no Sigstore dependency**, EU-
sovereign by design.

* Offline **Root** key signs `root.json`, which delegates to a rotating
  online **Targets** key. `root.json` carries a monotonic `version` and
  a `valid_until` window so a stale-replay attacker cannot freeze a
  recall mid-flight.
* Targets-key rotation is transparent: a fresh Targets pubkey lands in
  a new `root.json`, signed by the offline Root. Clients pick it up on
  next sync.
* Hard-fail on every signature/freshness/replay error — kill-switch
  must reach clients reliably.
* No `--accept-unsigned-registry` runtime flag (would be a downgrade
  vector). `REQUIRE_SIGNED_REGISTRY` is a build-time constant.

## Language & Internationalization

Cognithor ships with a **JSON-based i18n language pack system** (since v0.33.0). The default language is English, switchable via the Flutter Command Center or `config.yaml`.

### How It Works

```python
from cognithor.i18n import t, set_locale

set_locale("en")  # or "de"
print(t("error.timeout"))  # "The operation timed out..."
```

- **Language packs**: JSON files in `src/cognithor/i18n/locales/` (e.g., `en.json`, `de.json`)
- **Dot-notation keys**: `{"error": {"timeout": "..."}}` → `t("error.timeout")`
- **Fallback chain**: Current locale → English → raw key
- **SHA-256 integrity**: Optional `.sha256` sidecar files for community pack verification
- **Thread-safe**: Locale switching via `set_locale()` is thread-safe

### Switching Language

1. **Flutter Command Center**: General → "Sprache / Language" dropdown, or click the language button in the header
2. **Config file**: Set `language: en` in `~/.cognithor/config.yaml`
3. **Environment variable**: `COGNITHOR_LANGUAGE=en`

| Area | i18n Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Error messages** | Fully i18n | `utils/error_messages.py` uses `t()` |
| **Tool names** | Fully i18n | All 20 MCP tools have translated names |
| **Personality / Greetings** | Fully i18n | Greetings, empathy, success messages |
| **System prompts** (Planner) | i18n keys | Prompt templates in language packs |
| **Flutter Command Center** | Partial | Config labels still hardcoded (planned) |
| **Log messages** | English only | structlog keys are not translated |

### Contributing Translations

1. Copy `src/cognithor/i18n/locales/en.json` to `<locale>.json` (e.g., `zh.json`, `fr.json`)
2. Translate all ~250 string values
3. Run `python -c "from cognithor.i18n import generate_pack_hash; generate_pack_hash('<locale>')"`
4. Submit a PR

## What's New

### v0.99.0 — Resilient Workflow Engine (2026-05-06)

A single-feature release: the **Cognithor Resilient Workflow Engine (CRWE)** —
a transactional batch task runner with crash-recovery, signal-safety, and
audit-chain integration. **PR #499 — ~1,030 LOC core + 885 LOC tests, 28
tests (26 pass + 2 POSIX-only-skipped on Windows), crash-recovery
integration test PASSES on Windows under SIGKILL.**

- **`cognithor task <manifest.jsonl>`** — new CLI subcommand for batch
  task execution. Streams JSONL line-by-line (no full-file load), per-task
  `fsync()` on `results.jsonl` (max 1 task lost on power-fail), modulo-N
  atomic `.checkpoint.json` writes for fast resume.
- **`--resume`** — picks up where it left off. Validates manifest sha256
  (gap-injection detection), results sha256, line count, schema version.
  Mismatch raises explicit error with observed + expected hashes — never
  silent corruption.
- **Concurrency-safe** — `.checkpoint.lock` (POSIX `fcntl.flock` / Windows
  `msvcrt.locking`); second runner raises `WorkflowAlreadyRunning(pid)`
  instead of fighting over `results.jsonl`.
- **Signal-safe** — `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` flag-and-finish: in-flight task
  completes cleanly, then emergency-checkpoint, then exit. Async-
  cancellation-safe.
- **Audit-chain integration** — `system_checkpoint_created` and
  `workflow_resumed` events route via `AuditLogger.log_system`,
  hash-chained per SEC-HIGH-5. Closes the gap-injection attack vector:
  operator can prove cryptographically that no `results.jsonl` tampering
  happened while the workflow was offline.
- **Configurable** — `--checkpoint-every N` (default 12), `--workflow-id`
  override, `--handler MODULE:FUNCTION` for both sync and async handlers,
  auto-`workflow_id` from `{manifest_stem}_{sha8}_{YYYYMMDD}` so re-runs
  resume deterministically.

### v0.98.0 — Compliance-Spring (2026-05-06)

A four-PR audit-completeness suite plus a nightly regression-protection
workflow, riding on top of 12 test-coverage PRs that closed long-standing
gaps. Builds on v0.97.0 "Operational Trust" by transforming the reflective
learning path of the agent from "best-effort prose into a free-form log"
into "every autonomous memory write produces a structured, hash-chained,
encrypted-at-rest audit event". **5 PRs (#494, #496, #495, #497, #498) +
12 test-coverage PRs (~545 new tests), 0 regressions, mypy --strict + ruff
clean.**

- **PR-A — Reflector audit-event helper.** New `AuditCategory.REFLECTION`
  + `AuditLogger.log_reflection_event(...)` domain channel. Helper computes
  NFC-normalised SHA-256 over canonical-JSON payloads.
  `CausalAnalyzer.record_sequence` is now atomic-with-audit-emit via
  `with conn:` — no DB INSERT lands without its audit event. (#494)
- **PR-B — WeightOptimizer encrypted snapshots.** Search-ranking weights
  snapshotted as Fernet-encrypted `.fernet` files (content-addressed by
  SHA-256) + plaintext `.meta.json` sidecars at
  `~/.cognithor/weight_snapshots/`. Closes the inference-side-channel.
  Hardcoded `channel_contributions` workaround replaced by real per-channel
  shares from `MemorySearchResult` scores. (#496)
- **PR-C — Hypothesis property tests.** 8 properties asserting audit-chain
  invariants: write-event 1:1 correspondence, canonical-form parity, NFC
  idempotency, hash determinism, chain validity. (#495)
- **PR-D — Sink Stabilizer.** 3 remaining Reflector sinks
  (`_write_episodic`, `_write_semantic`, `_write_procedural`) emit
  REFLECTION events. `procedure_auto_created` includes
  `learned_text_sha256` provenance hash — every auto-created procedure
  is cryptographically tied to its source session (closes the
  "Geister-Prozeduren" gap for regulators). `MIGRATION_LEDGER` advances
  to `v2-reflection-completeness`. (#497)
- **Nightly burn-in workflow** — daily 03:00 UTC, 50 synthetic PGE-runs
  against isolated `$RUNNER_TEMP/cognithor-burnin/`, fails on any RED
  metric verdict (storage / audit-emit / atomic-rollback). (#498)
- **9 REFLECTION event types live** across all four autonomous Reflector
  sinks (causal, weight, episodic, semantic, procedural) with skip-events
  for non-write paths so the audit chain proves *"Reflector ran, decided
  not to persist"* instead of going silent.
- **Coverage closure**: Flutter providers 27/27, top-level screens 45/45,
  VS-Code 5/6 source files unit-tested, backend deep tests for
  agent_vault, post_processing, message_handler, pge_loop, mcp/browser,
  mcp/database_tools.

### v0.97.0 — Operational Trust (2026-05-04)

A reviewer-feedback-driven release that closes Cognithor's "post-mortem
reconstruction" gap. Every audit-relevant decision the agent makes is now
captured as a structured, queryable, signed receipt — not a free-form log
string. **42 PRs (#395–#437), ~10,500 LOC, ~330 new tests, 0 regressions,
mypy --strict + ruff clean across the new surface.**

The canonical reference for the stack is **[`docs/operational_trust.md`](docs/operational_trust.md)**.

- **TRUST-1 Run Receipts** — `AuditLogger.run_receipt(run_id, *, include_trust, signing_key)`
  aggregates every audit entry for a run into a deterministic JSON bundle
  with optional HMAC-SHA-256 signature. Five new CLI subcommands
  (`cognithor receipt show / verify / list / export-all / diff`) and a
  REST endpoint `GET /api/crew/trace/{trace_id}/receipt?include_trust=true`
  give operators a single front door for post-mortems.
- **TRUST-2 Decision Explanations** — every Gatekeeper block path (12 sites)
  now attaches a structured `DecisionExplanation` (`rule_id`, `rule_source`,
  `matched_pattern`) so downstream tools can render a precise "why we said no"
  instead of parsing prose.
- **TRUST-3 Failure-Mode Taxonomy** — `FailureMode` `StrEnum` with 15 canonical
  values; aggregated per-run via `AuditLogger.failure_mode_summary(run_id)`.
- **TRUST-4 Pack Rollback** — `cognithor pack rollback <id> [--to-version VER]`
  restores a pack to a prior version and seals the rollback into the audit chain.
- **TRUST-5..10 Operational-Trust Stack** — six independent append-only
  ledgers (Provenance, Permission-Scopes, Tool-Fingerprints, Cloud-Escalation,
  Cost, Migration). 9 memory-tier capture sites, 4 of 5 fingerprint kinds
  captured, integer micro-USD as the canonical cost unit. The composer
  `build_trust_bundle(run_id)` folds all six into a single receipt block.
- **Append-only audit hash chain** — each entry seals the previous SHA-256;
  receipts surface tamper events explicitly.
- **Sprint-27 plan-doc** ([`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-04-sprint27-ide-integration.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-04-sprint27-ide-integration.md))
  — forward-looking VS-Code / JetBrains / Cursor extension plan that
  consumes the new receipt API.

> Disk persistence of the TRUST ledgers (SQLCipher), TRUST-7 `BINARY`-kind
> capture, and TRUST-8 backend-dispatch wiring are scaffolded but ship
> in 0.98.x — the CLI + REST surfaces above are the supported entry points
> today.

### v0.96.0 — ARC-AGI-3 Pass (2026-05-01)

- **100 % success on the committed `cognithor_bench/arc_agi3` corpus** (20 tasks: train + held-out + hard).
  Up from 75 % in v0.95.0. Reproduce with:
  `python -m cognithor.channels.program_synthesis.synthesis.arc_baseline_runner --subset hard`
- **5 new object-level DSL primitives** (registry 61 → 66): `tile_3x`, `remove_singletons`,
  `count_components`, `recolor_by_component_size`, `unique_colors_diagonal`.
- **Phase-2 Production-Wiring**: `WiredPhase2Engine` glues Phase-1 EnumerativeSearch
  with the Sprint-1 Refiner pipeline. New CLI flags `--phase2 --arc-corpus PATH
  --arc-subset NAME` for A/B benchmarking.
- **End-to-end 5-factor verifier** (demo_pass / partial_pixel / invariants /
  triviality / suspicion) per spec §7.3.3.
- **Nightly Phase-2 benchmark workflow** with 10 PP regression gate.
- **Score trajectory**: hard subset went 12.5 % → 25 % → 50 % → 100 % over Sprints 5-8.
- **Fix**: `test_tls_config.py` no longer uses `openssl` subprocess (eliminates 11
  occasional Win-py3.12 failures in 16k-test full-repo runs).

### v0.95.0 — Trace-UI (2026-04-27)

- **Live-Visibility for running Crews** — new Flutter Trace-UI screen with master-detail
  list + timeline-log + per-agent stats sidebar. Owner-gated.
- **`cognithor.crew.trace_bus.TraceBus`** — in-process pub/sub hooked into
  `compiler.append_audit()`; broadcasts crew lifecycle + per-trace events to
  WebSocket subscribers without changing the Hashline-Guard JSONL persistence.
- **REST endpoints `/api/crew/traces`, `/trace/{id}`, `/trace/{id}/stats`** — read
  the existing audit chain for replay + history. Corruption-tolerant; surfaces
  skipped-line counts via `meta`.
- **WebSocket message types `crew_lifecycle_subscribe` / `crew_subscribe` /
  `crew_unsubscribe`** for live event streaming. Disconnect auto-cleans.
- **AutoGen-Shim coverage verified** — `cognithor.compat.autogen.AssistantAgent.run()`
  routes through `cognithor.crew.Crew` so AutoGen-shim runs surface in Trace-UI.
- **Owner-Token gating** — `cognithor.security.owner.require_owner` reads
  `COGNITHOR_OWNER_USER_ID` env (fallback: `pyproject.toml` author name).

### v0.94.0 — AutoGen Strategy Adoption (2026-04-25)

- **`cognithor.compat.autogen`** — source-compat shim for `autogen-agentchat==0.7.5`.
  Search-and-replace migration path for AutoGen-AgentChat code onto Cognithor's
  PGE-Trinity. See [migration guide](src/cognithor/compat/autogen/README.md).
- **`cognithor_bench/`** — reproducible Multi-Agent benchmark scaffold with
  `cognithor-bench run|tabulate` console tool and Cognithor / AutoGen adapters.
- **`examples/insurance-agent-pack/`** — standalone-installable DACH insurance
  pre-advisory reference pack with visible ComplianceGatekeeper PGE-demo.
- **Architecture Decision Records** — first ADR
  ([0001 — PGE Trinity vs Group Chat](docs/adr/0001-pge-trinity-vs-group-chat.md))
  documents why Cognithor doesn't adopt SelectorGroupChat / Swarm patterns.
- **Competitive analysis docs** — comparison with AutoGen, MAF, LangGraph,
  CrewAI under [`docs/competitive-analysis/`](docs/competitive-analysis/README.md).

### v0.92.7 (2026-04-23)
- **Video input via vLLM** — end-to-end video analysis in chat using Qwen3.6-27B or any vLLM-served VLM. Paperclip → "Video hochladen" or paste a direct `.mp4`/`.webm`/`.mov`/`.mkv`/`.avi` URL. Adaptive frame sampling via `ffprobe` (short clips: `fps=3`, long clips: `num_frames=32`), 500 MB per-file cap + 5 GB quota with LRU eviction, session-lifetime + 24 h TTL cleanup, no silent fallback to Ollama (Ollama has no vision). Windows installer now bundles LGPL ffmpeg + CI verifies the GPL-free build. See [`docs/vllm-user-guide.md`](docs/vllm-user-guide.md).
- **Default vLLM image flipped to `cu130-nightly`** — the tagged `v0.19.1` crashes Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4 at warmup on SM120 (Blackwell / RTX 50xx). The nightly ships the `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` fix. Day-1 spike findings at [`docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-04-23-video-input-vllm-spike-findings.md`](docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-04-23-video-input-vllm-spike-findings.md).
- **Orchestrator unified** — `backends_api` and `Gateway` now share a single `VLLMOrchestrator` instance via `app.state`, so `media_url` wired after the media server starts actually reaches the `docker run` command.
- **14,118 Python tests + 31 Flutter tests passing** (+180 new for this release), 0 failures, 0 ruff errors.

### v0.92.2 (2026-04-19)
- **Windows Launcher Hardening** — `Cognithor.exe` (the .NET tray app) no longer vanishes silently on startup. All exceptions in the AppShell constructor are now caught, logged to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Cognithor\launcher-crash.log`, and shown via MessageBox. Previously a missing `python\python.exe` (e.g. AV quarantine) would throw `FileNotFoundException` before `Application.Run()` started the message loop, making the process disappear from Task Manager with no trace.
- **Python Resolution 3-Tier Fallback** — Both `Cognithor.exe` and the installer-generated `cognithor.bat` now resolve Python in this order: (1) bundled `<install>\python\python.exe`, (2) `python`/`py` on PATH, (3) well-known install paths (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python313|312`, `%ProgramFiles%\Python313|312`, `C:\Python313|312`). Users who installed Python without ticking "Add to PATH" (the default since Python 3.9) are no longer broken.
- **Single-Instance Guard Actually Works** — The process-wide `Mutex` in `Program.cs` is no longer scoped with `using`, which previously disposed it at first return and defeated the guard. Now released explicitly in `finally`.
- **Graceful Python-Missing UX** — `ProcessManager.StartPython` no longer throws when Python is missing. Instead it sets `PythonMissing = true`, and the tray icon shows "Backend not installed" with a balloon tip explaining what's wrong.
- **Square Logos** — `flutter_app/assets/logo.png` and `assets/cognithor_logo.png` were 1536×1024 non-square and got cropped in every UI that used `BoxFit.cover`. Regenerated as 1024×1024 square from `Icon-512.png`. `cognithor_banner.png` rebuilt as 1920×640 dark-theme banner with the logo centered. `cognithor-logo.png` bumped from 52×52 to 192×192 (PWA standard).
- **Flutter web `index.html` branding** — replaced leftover `jarvis_ui` title + apple-touch-title and the default "A new Flutter project." description with real Cognithor branding.
- **Release-workflow idempotency** — explicit release-notes generation replaces `generate_release_notes: true`. The old setup prepended a fresh `**Full Changelog**: ...` line on every workflow re-run; `append_body: false` now guarantees idempotent re-runs.
- **Installer Build Fixes** — `subprocess.run(["flutter",...])` on Windows now resolves via `shutil.which` (flutter is a `.bat`); failed `flutter build windows` (e.g. Developer Mode off) is caught as soft-fail so the rest of the installer still builds; `step_inno_setup` reports the correct version instead of alphabetically-first.
- **Legacy `jarvis_ui.exe` fallback removed** from `ProcessManager.FindDesktopUi` — the only accepted name is `cognithor_ui.exe` (v0.42.0 rename).

### v0.92.1 (2026-04-18)
- **E2E Audit Fixes** — `zh.json` JSON syntax error (unescaped ASCII quotes inside Chinese text, line 458-460) — Chinese locale silently fell back to English until now. Fixed with `「」` corner brackets.
- **Test isolation** — 3× fixture bug in `test_enhanced_integration.py` passed `jarvis_dir=` (unknown field, silently ignored by Pydantic), causing `MemoryManager` to hit the real `~/.cognithor/db/` and fail with "database disk image is malformed". Now uses `jarvis_home=` + all 52 Config classes have `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` so unknown kwargs fail loudly.
- **Tool-Risk Decorator** — `@cognithor_tool(risk_level="green"|"yellow"|"orange"|"red")` + `PackManifest.tool_risks` field. PackLoader pushes declared risks into `mcp_client._tool_registry` on load. Previously 15/18 pack tools defaulted to ORANGE (user approval required for read-only scans); now every pack tool gets its declared level.
- **CI Hardening** — new `scripts` job runs `verify_all.py` and `smoke_test.py` so these stop rotting outside CI. New `flutter` job runs `dart analyze` and `flutter test`. Lint job gains full `ruff check` + `ruff format --check`.
- **UTF-8 on Windows** — `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` + `PYTHONUTF8=1` added to `start_cognithor.bat` and `install.bat`. `_DEFAULT_CORE_MEMORY` template now ships real umlauts ("Identität") instead of ASCII fallback ("Identitaet").
- **Scripts repaired** — `smoke_test.py` cp1252-crash fixed (box-drawing + checkmark chars → ASCII `[OK]`/`[WARN]`/`[FAIL]`); `live_smoke_test.py` stdout UTF-8 + legacy `jarvis.config` import + `list_models()` API signature; `verify_all.py` completely rewritten for v0.92.x architecture (was checking deleted `cognithor.social` module and stale `src/jarvis/` paths).
- **Flutter ARB parity** — 11 missing keys added to `app_zh.arb` + `app_ar.arb` (connectionLost, actionApproved, errorWithDetail, …).
- **Lint + format green** — 90 ruff errors resolved (74 auto-fix + 16 manual), 17 dart-analyze issues resolved; `ruff format --check` now clean.
- **13,791 tests passing** (+19 new tool-risk tests), 0 failures.

### v0.92.0 (2026-04-16)
- **Agent Pack Architecture** — Full plugin system for paid & free agent packs. `cognithor.packs` module: `PackManifest` (Pydantic v2), `PackLoader` (importlib isolation), `PackInstaller` (zip/URL + EULA click-through), CLI (`cognithor pack install|list|remove|update|accept-eula`). Packs live in `~/.cognithor/packs/` and register at startup.
- **Leads SDK** — `cognithor.leads` replaces the old `cognithor.social` module. Source-agnostic `LeadSource` ABC, `SourceRegistry`, `LeadService` orchestrator, `LeadStore` with `source_id` column. Any pack can register a lead source — Reddit, HN, Discord, RSS, or future custom sources.
- **Reddit Lead Hunter Pro** — First paid Agent Pack (€75 indie / €179 commercial via Lemon Squeezy). Extracted from Core into private `cognithor-packs` repo. Includes: Reddit scanner, 50 reply templates, Playwright auto-poster, style learner, subreddit discovery. Core retains zero Reddit-specific code.
- **3 Free Bundled Packs** — Hacker News Lead Hunter, Discord Lead Hunter, RSS Lead Hunter. Apache 2.0, auto-installed on first Cognithor start. Same pack interface as paid packs.
- **cognithor.ai** — Marketing site deployed on Vercel. Build-time pack catalog fetch from private GitHub repo via Octokit. Auto-rebuild on pack repo push via deploy hook. Pack detail pages with strikethrough pricing, checkout flow, post-purchase install command page.
- **Flutter Pack-Aware UI** — `PackPreviewOverlay` shows real pack UI greyed out with unlock CTA. `LockedPackCard` for free packs. `SourcesProvider` polls `/api/v1/leads/sources`. Leads tab gated on registered sources. Settings → Social shows Reddit config disabled with "Get this Pack" overlay when pack not installed.
- **Anti-Enshittification Promise** — `/promise` page: Core stays free forever, packs add but never subtract, zero telemetry. "This isn't marketing copy. It's a contract. If we ever break it, fork the repo."
- **EULA System** — Every pack ships `eula.md` with SHA-256 pinned in manifest. Installer prompts click-through, persists acceptance. Loader rejects packs with hash mismatch or missing acceptance.
- **`src/cognithor/social/` DELETED** — 15 Python files (~4000 LOC) extracted to agent packs. Gateway rewritten for source-agnostic `LeadService`. No backward compatibility shim remains.
- **13,600+ tests passing** across Core + packs + site (657 vitest)

### v0.91.0 (2026-04-14)
- **Unified Leads Engine** — Generalized the Reddit-only lead system into a multi-source engine (#113). RSS/Atom feed scanner (stdlib `xml.etree`, no new deps), configurable per-source in Flutter Settings → Social. Sidebar Leads tab gated on `leads_engine_enabled` — hidden when all sources disabled.
- **Installer Language Fix** — Inno Setup language choice now persists to Cognithor config (#114). `install_language.txt` marker from installer → `bootstrap_windows.py` reads before OS-locale fallback. `first_run.py` skips the language question when marker present.
- **OLLAMA_HOST Normalization** — `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` no longer crashes httpx (#115). `_normalize_ollama_url()` helper accepts bare hosts, host:port, full URLs. Wired as `default_factory` + `before` validator on `OllamaConfig.base_url`.
- **13,500+ tests passing**

### v0.90.0 (2026-04-11)
- **Cross-Platform Social Listening** — Hacker News (Firebase + Algolia API, zero auth) + Discord (REST API v10, bot token) scanners join Reddit. Unified `social_scan` and `social_leads` MCP tools. Per-platform config: intervals, min scores, categories/channels. Flutter config UI with HN + Discord sections.
- **Hierarchical Document Reasoning** — 4th retrieval channel: tree-based section navigation for PDF, DOCX, HTML, Markdown, plaintext. `TreeBuilder` + `NodeSelector` (LLM-navigated) + `TreeStore` (SQLite). No embeddings required — structural understanding through heading hierarchy.
- **CAG Layer (Cache-Augmented Generation)** — Deterministic prefix generation for LLM KV-cache reuse. `PrefixBuilder` (Ollama-compatible) + `NativeLlamaCppBuilder`, `ContentNormalizer`, `CacheStore`, hit-rate metrics. Hooks into Planner for automatic prefix injection.
- **CLI Config TUI** — Interactive terminal config editor via `cognithor --config-tui`. Dynamic model discovery from live LLM providers, section navigation, validation, rich formatting.
- **AST-Based Security** — Python `ast.NodeVisitor` guard (40 tests) + `bashlex` shell parser (48 tests) replace regex-based code analysis. Detects dangerous imports, subprocess calls, eval, network access at syntax tree level.

### What's New in v0.74.0

**ARC-AGI-3: 13/25 Games Solved (24 Levels) — SmartExplorer Breakthrough**

Inspired by the [3rd-place ARC-AGI-3 Preview solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24156), the new SmartExplorer uses systematic state-action graph exploration to solve 7 previously unsolvable games in a single session.

- **SmartExplorer** (`smart_explorer.py`): Tracks tested/untested actions per state, navigates to nearest frontier via BFS on known transitions, prunes no-effect actions, detects click targets via connected components. No ML — pure graph search with smart prioritization
- **7 new games solved**: TR87 (block-matching, 90 steps), BP35 (platformer, 32 steps), CD82 (5 steps), TU93 (18 steps), KA59 (184s), SU15 (122s), TN36 (131s)
- **Key insight**: systematic action testing at every state + frontier navigation >> blind DFS. The SmartExplorer tests every action at every reachable state and navigates back to states with untested actions via shortest known path
- **VisionAgent** (`vision_agent.py`): Prototype for qwen3-vl guided step-by-step gameplay
- **Action 7 fix**: Was completely dropped from keyboard solver filter — now included
- **Clicks as DFS actions**: Click positions are regular DFS branches, enabling multi-click sequences
- **Incremental click-DFS**: For deep click puzzles (LP85 L2), steps forward with env.step instead of replaying
- **Click path shortening**: Removes redundant clicks from solutions
- **Full benchmark**: All 25 games tested: FT09(10), VC33(2), LP85(2), SP80(1), CN04(1), M0R0(1), TR87(1), BP35(1), CD82(1), TU93(1), KA59(1), SU15(1), TN36(1)

### What's New in v0.73.0

**ARC-AGI-3: 7/25 Games Solved — ClickSequenceSolver + KeyboardSolver** — Three solver families covering click, keyboard, and mixed game types.

- **Path shortening**, false positive detection, pump-then-trigger architecture

### What's New in v0.72.0

**ARC-AGI-3: GameAnalyzer + Smart Solver** — Fully automated game analysis and solving pipeline for click-based ARC-AGI-3 games.

- **GameAnalyzer** (`game_analyzer.py`): Sacrifices one level to learn game mechanics, 2 vision calls (qwen3-vl:32b) for strategy guidance, persistent GameProfile cache
- **PerGameSolver** (`per_game_solver.py`): Budget-based strategy mix, smart elimination search with poison-cluster removal
- **760x faster combo testing**: `env.reset()` (0.5ms) replaces `arcade.make()` (380ms)
- **FT09: 10/10 levels solved** (reproducible, ~1s per level after analysis)
- **Toggle-pair detection**: Automatically identifies clickable colors from sacrifice level data

- **Auto-Update on Startup** — `plugins.auto_update` and `marketplace.auto_update` now trigger community registry sync at gateway startup
- **Lint Zero** — 393 lint errors (F401, F541, F841, E501, E741, E402) cleaned to zero across the entire codebase
- **MCP tools: 51 → 53** (added A2A delegation tools)
- **11,769+ tests passing** (0 failures)

### v0.34.3-beta — REPLAN Loop Fix, Full English UI, Tool Schemas

- **REPLAN Loop Fix** — Deep architectural fix to PGE loop: detects bare REPLAN text, consecutive no-tool iterations, and coding task caps to prevent infinite replanning
- **Full English UI** — All remaining German strings in legacy React Control Center translated (cron.js, A2A descriptions, icons, prompts)
- **Tool Schemas in CORE.md** — Auto-inventory now shows full parameter signatures (`tool(param: type *)`) instead of bare names
- **Chrome Autofill Defense** — GlobalSearch and provider filter inputs protected against Chrome autofill interference
- **Renamed "MCP & A2A" → "Integrations"** — Clearer page label in Command Center
- **Backend Startup Fix** — Vite now verifies jarvis importability before selecting a Python interpreter; bootstrap auto-repairs broken venvs

### v0.33.0-beta — i18n Language Packs, 4 Critical Bug Fixes

- **i18n Language Pack System** — JSON-based internationalization with dot-notation keys, SHA-256 integrity verification, fallback chain (locale → EN → raw key), thread-safe locale switching. Ships with German and English packs (~250 keys each)
- **Language Switcher in UI** — Command Center header quick-toggle (DE/EN) + General page dropdown. Language changes are live — no restart needed
- **Bug Fix: Planner JSON Parse Retry** — When the LLM returns malformed JSON, the planner now automatically retries with format hints instead of silently failing ("task failed successfully")
- **Bug Fix: LLM Timeout Wiring** — Embedding timeouts now respect the configured `timeout_seconds` instead of hardcoded values. LLM timeout is now visible on the Executor page for all backends
- **Bug Fix: WebSocket Race Condition** — All 12 `send_json()` calls in the WebSocket handler are now protected against disconnection errors via `_ws_safe_send()`. No more "Cannot call send" crashes
- **Bug Fix: GlobalSearch** — Added missing pages (Executor, Workflows, Knowledge Graph) to FIELD_INDEX and PAGE_LABELS. Search now finds all 19 config pages
- **11,769+ tests passing** (0 failures)

### v0.30.0 — mTLS, Document Reading, DB Retry

- **Document Reading** — 3 new MCP tools: `read_pdf` (PyMuPDF), `read_ppt` (python-pptx), `read_docx` (python-docx) with structured output, formatting, tables, images, metadata
- **mTLS for WebUI API** — Mutual TLS with auto-generated CA/server/client certificates; prevents unauthorized API access (`security.mtls.enabled`)
- **DB Retry Logic** — SQLite retries "database is locked" with exponential backoff + jitter (configurable)
- **MCP tools: 48 → 51**

**Previous Releases**
