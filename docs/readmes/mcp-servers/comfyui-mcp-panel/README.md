No setup.

**Stuck or have a question? [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/cW9arBhzCu)** — or hit **🆘 Need help?** in the panel's Settings → About (it copies a diagnostics summary and opens the Discord for you).

Pick a provider — **Claude** or **ChatGPT** — and the matching agent runs in the background on
*your* subscription, sees the graph you're looking at, and edits it live. Both providers reach
**full feature parity**: the same live-canvas tools, the same model knowledge, the same one-shot
workflow loads, the same cost guardrail.

Part of the **[comfyui-mcp](https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp)** project — the local-first,
agent-native control plane for ComfyUI (MCP server + agent orchestrator). Full documentation at
**[comfyui-mcp.artokun.io/docs](https://comfyui-mcp.artokun.io/docs)**.

Type "add a KSampler and wire it to my checkpoint" in the panel and watch nodes
appear on the canvas. Every edit is undoable with **Ctrl+Z**.

**No API keys. No extra LLM costs.** The agent runs on your Claude *or* ChatGPT
subscription — a background [comfyui-mcp](https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp)
**orchestrator** the panel starts for you when you click **Connect**. The panel
is just its window into your graph.

```
this panel ⇄ loopback bridge ⇄ comfyui-mcp orchestrator (background, Claude OR ChatGPT — your subscription) ⇄ your graph
```

Each provider runs its own orchestrator on its own loopback port (Claude on
`ws://127.0.0.1:9180`), so you can pick a provider rather than juggle ports.

## Features

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Pick a provider** | A backend picker with **Claude** / **ChatGPT** chips — choose the agent, not a port. Switching providers starts a fresh chat (sessions aren't shared across providers) and posts a system note. |
| **Provider onboarding** | Connect-time readiness detection per provider (CLI on PATH + a login on disk; macOS Keychain handled). An onboarding card shows only when neither provider is signed in; the panel auto-switches to a ready provider when your saved pick isn't usable (your saved preference is untouched), and a not-ready row becomes a "set up" action. |
| **Live-canvas building** | The agent adds, wires, moves, retitles, colors, collapses, groups, and lays out nodes on the graph you're viewing — all through a fixed `panel_*` allowlist (no arbitrary JS), every edit undoable with **Ctrl+Z**. |
| **One-shot workflow / pack load** | `panel_load_workflow` drops a whole graph onto the canvas in one call — load a bundled installer pack's local-GPU workflow by name without shuttling the JSON through the chat. |
| **Local-GPU vs paid-API awareness** | Bundled packs are local/free; for ad-hoc graphs the agent checks the runtime (`check_workflow_runtime`) and **asks before spending paid API credits**. |
| **Installer packs + skills** | The agent discovers bundled model-family skills and one-command installer packs, then applies the manifest and loads the ready workflow instead of hand-building a graph. |
| **Rewind & rollback** | Roll back **code** (graph), **conversation** (fork the session), or **both** from any past message, plus `/revert` and double-Esc quick rewind. |
| **Autonomous install → restart → continue** | Install custom nodes through your own ComfyUI Manager, restart ComfyUI to load them, and the panel auto-reconnects so the agent resumes its task. |
| **Reasoning effort + model selector** | A per-provider effort/model picker — Claude's models, or ChatGPT's GPT-5-class models via Codex — moved into the model selector; a chosen effort survives a provider switch by mapping to the nearest valid level. |
| **Pending-message tray + reconnect durability** | Queue messages while the agent is busy (edit / send-now / reorder), and reclaim a wedged orchestrator on Connect. |
| **Apps (micro-apps)** | Convert any workflow into a named, one-click **app** (name, description, thumbnail, chosen input/output endpoints) from the toolbar's **Apps** button — runs headless (the canvas is never touched), locally or on a connected RunPod pod, with best-effort hidden-workflow packaging and a publish/explore registry (`registry/`, Cloudflare Worker + D1 + R2) shared with the mobile app. |

## Quickstart

1. **Install the pack** — search `comfyui-agent-panel` in ComfyUI-Manager, or
   `git clone https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp-panel` into
   `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`. Restart ComfyUI; an **Agent** tab (💬) appears in the sidebar.
2. **Sign in to your provider once** so the agent can run on your subscription (Node ≥ 22):
   - Claude (via the Claude CLI): `claude` (or `claude setup-token`)
   - ChatGPT (via the Codex CLI): `codex login`
3. **Open the Agent tab**, pick **Claude** or **ChatGPT** in the backend picker,
   and click **Connect**. The panel starts that provider's background orchestrator
   on your subscription — no API keys — and the status pill turns green.
4. **Type a request** — "build a Flux txt2img graph and run it" — and watch the
   edits land on your canvas. **Disconnect** stops the agent; nothing is ever
   started without your click.

## Install

**Via ComfyUI-Manager** (recommended): search for `comfyui-agent-panel` and install.

**Via git:**

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp-panel
```

Restart ComfyUI. A new **Agent** tab (💬) appears in the sidebar.

## Connect

Sign in to the provider you want once so the agent can run on your subscription (Node ≥ 22):

```bash
claude        # Claude — or: claude setup-token
codex login   # ChatGPT (Codex)
```

Open the **Agent** tab, **pick a provider** in the backend picker (Claude /
ChatGPT chips), and click **Connect**. The panel starts that provider's
autonomous background agent — `npx -y comfyui-mcp@latest connect`, running
on your **subscription** (no API keys) — and the status pill turns green. Type a
request ("build a Flux txt2img graph and run it") and watch the edits land on
your canvas. **Disconnect** stops the agent; nothing is ever started without
your click.

Switching providers starts a fresh chat — conversations aren't shared across
Claude and ChatGPT — and the panel tells you so. Each provider runs its own
orchestrator on its own loopback port (Claude defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:9180`,
overridable via `COMFYUI_MCP_BRIDGE_PORT`), so you pick a provider rather than a
port. The bridge is loopback-only. To run an orchestrator yourself, set
`COMFYUI_MCP_NO_AUTOSPAWN=1`, launch it manually, then click Connect (the Bridge
URL lives under **Advanced**).

Type `/` in the composer for commands — panel ones like **`/reload`** (pick up
new code, keep the chat), **`/reload-ui`** (reload just the panel), **`/revert`**
(undo the last turn's graph edits), and **`/restart`** (recover an unresponsive
agent — kills the orchestrator and its child tree, starts fresh). On the Claude
backend, provider slash commands (`/compact`, `/loop`, …) are available too.

## What the agent can do

The agent drives the workflow you're viewing through a **fixed allowlist** of
`panel_*` commands (no arbitrary JavaScript). Every graph mutation goes through
LiteGraph's change tracking, so ComfyUI's native **Ctrl+Z** reverts an agent
edit exactly like your own. **Both providers expose this identical surface** —
the `panel_*` tools live in one shared definition list, registered onto the
in-process Claude Agent SDK server *and* a loopback HTTP MCP the orchestrator
hosts for the ChatGPT/Codex backend, so feature parity is automatic.

**Read**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_get_graph` | Read the graph you're viewing — subgraphs summarized shallowly |
| `panel_get_subgraph` | Read inside a subgraph node's inner graph |
| `panel_get_errors` | Read the last execution error + per-node validation errors |
| `panel_list_workflows` | List open workflow tabs and which is active |
| `panel_list_nodes` | List installed custom-node packs |
| `panel_list_mcp` | List connected MCP servers |
| `panel_get_content_mode` | Read the adult-content (NSFW) consent state |

**Edit the graph** (all undoable with Ctrl+Z)

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_add_node` | Add a node by class_type |
| `panel_remove_node` | Remove a node |
| `panel_connect` / `panel_disconnect` | Wire / unwire slots (by name or index) |
| `panel_set_widget` | Change a widget value (steps, cfg, prompts, …) |
| `panel_move_node` | Move a node on the canvas |
| `panel_set_node_title` | Rename a node's header title |
| `panel_clear` | Remove every node — the whole wipe is one Ctrl+Z |

**Subgraphs**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_select_nodes` | Select nodes on the canvas (multi-selection) |
| `panel_create_subgraph` | Group selected nodes into a subgraph ("Convert to Subgraph") |
| `panel_enter_subgraph` | Drill into a subgraph to read/edit its inner nodes |
| `panel_exit_subgraph` | Return to the parent / root graph |

**Spatial layout** — the agent sees node positions/sizes + subgraph rails and arranges the canvas

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_move_rail` | Move a subgraph's input / output rail so boundary wires stay short |
| `panel_create_group` / `panel_move_group` / `panel_edit_group` / `panel_remove_group` | Create, move, retitle/recolor, or delete a labeled group box |
| `panel_set_node_color` | Color-code a node (named LiteGraph preset or hex) |
| `panel_set_node_collapsed` | Collapse / expand a node to a title chip |
| `panel_screenshot` | Render the canvas to a PNG so the agent can verify its own layout |

**Workflow tabs**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_new_workflow` | Open a fresh blank workflow in a NEW tab (never wipes the current one) |
| `panel_open_workflow` | Switch to a workflow by path / filename |
| `panel_rename_workflow` | Rename a workflow |
| `panel_close_workflow` | Close a tab (refuses unsaved changes unless forced) |
| `panel_save_workflow` | Save / save-as programmatically (no dialog pops) |

**Load a whole workflow in one shot**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_load_workflow` | Replace the live graph with a full workflow in one call — prefer `pack:<name>` to load a bundled installer pack's local-GPU workflow without shuttling the JSON through chat. The replaced graph becomes an undo point (double-Esc / revert). |

**Knowledge & cost awareness** — the agent (Claude *or* ChatGPT) discovers bundled expertise and checks runtime cost before spending credits

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `list_skills` / `read_skill` | Discover and read bundled model-family + workflow skills (the same knowledge Claude loads natively, exposed to any backend) |
| `list_packs` / `read_pack_workflow` | List one-command installer packs (custom nodes + weights + ready workflow; all local-GPU / free) and read a pack's graph |
| `list_workflow_templates` | List the official ComfyUI workflow templates available on the connected server |
| `check_workflow_runtime` | Classify a workflow as **local** (your GPU, free) or **api** / **mixed** / **unknown** (hosted API nodes = paid credits) — the agent asks before spending paid API credits |

**Run & view**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_run` | Queue the open workflow (same as pressing Queue Prompt) |
| `panel_canvas` | Fit, center on a node, pan, or zoom your view |

**Custom nodes — via your built-in ComfyUI Manager**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_search_nodes` | Search installable node packs (the Manager's own source) |
| `panel_install_node` | Queue a pack install (registry id or git URL) |
| `panel_node_queue_status` | Check the Manager's install / update queue |
| `panel_restart_comfyui` | Restart ComfyUI to load new nodes — panel auto-reconnects and the agent resumes |

**MCP & session**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_add_mcp` / `panel_remove_mcp` | Connect / remove an MCP server in your agent's MCP config (Claude or Codex) |
| `panel_request_secret` | Securely collect an API token — the agent never sees the value |
| `panel_reload` | Soft-reload the orchestrator (new code/tools) or the panel UI, then resume |

**Working with you**

| Tool | Effect |
|---|---|
| `panel_ask` | Ask you to choose between options (renders a question card, waits for your pick) |
| `panel_set_todo` | Show a live TODO checklist in the footer tray |
| `panel_request_adult_consent` / `panel_disable_adult_mode` | Toggle the 18+ NSFW consent gate |

…plus the full comfyui-mcp tool surface (queue, models, custom nodes, workflows,
generation) — the agent is the MCP client, so it has everything. The headless
comfyui MCP is injected into both backends (in-process for Claude; declared to
`codex app-server` via `-c mcp_servers` for ChatGPT), so this surface is
identical across providers.

## Working in the panel

- **Rewind & rollback.** Hover any past message for a **✎ edit** button that
  opens a modal to roll back **code** (the graph), **conversation**
  (fork the session), or **both**, then resend an edited message. Plus
  **`/revert`** (undo the last turn's graph edits) and **double-Esc** (quick
  last-turn rewind — revert the graph and recall the message to edit). Graph
  reverts use per-turn snapshots.
- **Pending-message tray.** Messages sent while the agent is busy wait in a
  fixed **Pending** tray above the downloads tray — each with edit / send-now /
  delete buttons. **Send-now** interrupts the current turn to steer it; a drag
  handle (≡) reorders how the agent flushes them. On dequeue a message
  materializes at the **bottom** of the chat, so it flows in the exact order
  the agent (Claude or ChatGPT) processes it.
- **Destructive-op confirmation.** `panel_clear` and `panel_restart_comfyui`
  pop a yes / no card and only act on **yes**.
- **Reconnect durability.** A wedged orchestrator no longer strands the panel —
  **Connect** reclaims a zombie that still holds the bridge port.
- **Richer composer attachments.** Attach, drag, or paste **images, video,
  workflow `.json`, and text** files into the composer. Attachments show as
  expandable **chips** above the input (kind icon + label; click to preview the
  full content, × to remove), and **pasted text renders inline** in the sent
  bubble — verbatim, exactly as if you'd typed it, rather than a raw
  `[Pasted text #N]` token.
- **Rich media metadata.** When a render's media is pushed to the agent, the
  executed-event note includes each output's path (subfolder-relative), file
  size, pixel dimensions, asset-set grouping ("output K of N from this run" +
  sibling filenames), render duration, and completion time — videos add format +
  real frame count / fps.
- **Code-block tools.** Rendered fenced code blocks get a **Copy** button plus a
  persisted global **line-wrap** toggle (off by default); inline code gets Copy.
- **Streamed replies in background tabs.** Switching away from the ComfyUI tab
  mid-turn no longer leaves an empty bubble with a stuck cursor — the reply
  finalizes synchronously while the tab is hidden and flushes on
  `visibilitychange`, so long pipeline runs render even if you tab away.
- **Render-stall warning.** A tunable stall threshold (Settings → General;
  default 180s, range 15–3600) warns when a render wedges; it's pushed **live**,
  so changing it applies without a reconnect.

## Security notes

- The bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` only — nothing is reachable from your LAN.
- The panel executes a fixed command set; no `eval`, no DOM access for the agent.
- No tokens or keys are stored anywhere in this pack.

## Requirements

- ComfyUI with a frontend exposing `app.extensionManager.registerSidebarTab` (any 2024+ release)
- Node ≥ 22 for the orchestrator (`npx -y comfyui-mcp@latest connect`, started for you by **Connect**)
- A subscription login for the provider you pick — **Claude** via the Claude CLI (`claude`) or **ChatGPT** via the Codex CLI (`codex login`). The agent runs on your subscription, no API key.

## Roadmap

- Remote pairing via a relay (PartyKit-style room codes) for ComfyUI-on-a-server setups
- Migration to `@comfyorg/extension-api` v2 when it ships (v1 call sites tagged `// TODO(v2):`)
