# HealthClaw Guardrails

### The open-source security layer between AI agents and clinical data.

*FHIR standardized how health data is structured. MCP standardized how AI connects to tools.*
***Nobody standardized the guardrails in between. This project does.***

> **What it is:** an open reference implementation of the FHIR × MCP guardrail layer — PHI redaction,
> immutable audit, step-up auth, and tenant isolation — that sits between *any* AI agent and *any* FHIR
> server. Built in the open as a community project, MIT-licensed. Not a product, not a pitch: if the
> pattern is useful, take it; if it's wrong, tell us or fix it.

**This is a community effort.** It's most useful when implementers, clinicians, and standards folks poke holes in it. Issues, PRs, and "you got the SDC extraction wrong" critiques are all welcome — start with **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** and the **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

**At a glance:** v1.9.0 · 1,490+ Python + 170 Node tests · 29 MCP tools · **[CareAgents](https://careagents.cloud)** hosted consumer app (passkey sign-in, advisors, web/Telegram/iMessage) · real-world action rail (provably out-of-band gate) · forms rail end-to-end (`$populate` → human review → provenance PDF) · FHIR R4 US Core v9 + R6 v6.0.0-ballot3 · HL7 SDC forms · NQF 0018 quality measure · lab interpreter (`$interpret`) · care-gaps reminders (`$care-gaps`) + embedded MCP-App view · ChatGPT-connector `search`/`fetch` · Fasten TEFCA · HealthEx · HBO · Flexpa · Epic · MEDENT · Open Wearables · SMART Health Links · Claude Code plugin · OpenAI/Gemini adapters

## Try it in 60 seconds — no clone, no keys

The hosted demo runs synthetic data behind the full guardrail stack:

```bash
# Watch the deployment grade its own guardrails (PHI redaction, audit, step-up, ...):
curl "https://app.healthclaw.io/r6/fhir/\$conformance?format=text"
```

Point any MCP client at the live server — URL `https://mcp-server-production-5112.up.railway.app/mcp`,
header `X-Tenant-Id: desktop-demo` — then ask: *"Search my health records for lab results and explain
them in plain language."* One-command installs:

## Release highlights

Full notes live in **[Releases](https://github.com/aks129/HealthClawGuardrails/releases)**.

| Version | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| **v1.9.0** | **[CareAgents](https://careagents.cloud) — the hosted consumer experience**: sign up with a passkey, connect records through a pluggable connector marketplace (Fasten, Apple Health via Open Wearables, sample data), and spin up a guardrailed health agent reachable on web, Telegram, and iMessage · **advisor registry** — specialties ported from SmartHealthConnect (healthy-habits, care-completion, medication-refills, diet-exercise) as prompt-blocks over the guarded tool set, deferred ones honestly labeled · **versioned informed consent** enforced server-side (HTTP 428) before any real-record connection · **forms rail ships end-to-end** — `$populate` → per-item human review (NKA never inferred) → provenance-stamped PDF → signed expiring link · **error fidelity is conformance property seven (Grade A = 7/7)**, hardened across both MCP transports with a Python↔TypeScript drift guard · **MCP Apps** — care-gaps results embed an engine-served UI (`text/html; profile=mcp-app`) whose only fetch target is the guarded operation · security pass: fail-closed prod config, authenticated tenant reads, MCP transport auth, Alembic · SmartHealthConnect archived (skills frozen at v1.2.0; advisors are the live successors) |
| **v1.8.0** | **Real-actions foundation** — an agent can *propose* a real-world action (call, SMS, form) but `commit` only *submits* it (HTTP 202); execution happens through a separate approval that requires a single-use step-up credential and an expiry-guarded atomic claim, so the agent's own toolchain can never approve its own action (the spoofable `X-Human-Confirmed` header is gone) · **`ActionExecutor` plugin registry** — add a real-world capability behind the full guardrail rail in ~50 lines, no core changes ([extend it](ROADMAP.md#extending-the-action-rail)) · mandatory red-flag emergency screen; fail-loud rails (no silent simulation) · **durable execution** — attempt ledger, provider reconciliation, external-tick reaper, append-only action-event log · **reliability floor** — config preflight (`GET /r6/ops/preflight`), Postgres CI lane, MCP fetch timeouts, poller 409-storm detection, source-aware resource identity `(tenant, type, id)`, Fasten hardening + zombie-job reaper · public [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) + contributor on-ramp · fixes: upstream FHIR error fidelity, quality measures default to current year |
| **v1.7.0** | Preventive care-gaps engine (`Patient/$care-gaps`, USPSTF/ACIP/ADA + eCQM crosswalk) · patient connect flow: identity-verified Fasten onboarding mints a webhook-gated, read-scoped 30-day agent token · prescription transfer requests (`rx_transfer_request`, Schedule II refused) — 29 MCP tools · [per-agent quickstarts](docs/quickstarts/) (Claude/Perplexity/ChatGPT/Telegram) · HBO export→FHIR converter + embedded-XML PHI scrubber · hardening: fail-closed webhook verify, scoped tokens, serverless write guard, live-path contract tests · clinical fixes: SNOMED diabetes detection, inclusive panic thresholds, one-sided-range honesty |
| **v1.6.0** | Lab reference-range interpreter (`Observation/$interpret`) · NQF 0018 quality measure (`Measure/$evaluate-measure`) · [any-agent-framework adapters](docs/recipes/any-agent-framework.md) (OpenAI/Gemini) · [Medplum-in-front recipe](docs/recipes/healthclaw-in-front-of-medplum.md) · SMBP triage on 2025 AHA/ACC · ruff lint gate · all dependency advisories remediated |
| v1.5.0 | Read-auth hardening (tenant reads authenticated, not just scoped) · HL7 SDC forms — `$populate` / `$extract` |
| v1.4.0 | Six health-data connectors (Fasten TEFCA, HealthEx, Health Bank One, Flexpa, Epic, MEDENT) behind one guardrail stack |
| v1.3.0 | Wearables → FHIR Observations (8 providers, LOINC/UCUM mapping, device Provenance) |
| v1.2.0 | Compiled Truth — current state + append-only Provenance trail per resource |

## What It Does

This is a **vendor-neutral guardrail proxy** that sits between any AI agent and any FHIR server. Every request passes through:

- **PHI redaction** — Names truncated to initials, identifiers masked, addresses stripped, birth dates truncated to year
- **Immutable audit trail** — Every read/write logged with tenant, agent, timestamp
- **Step-up authorization** — HMAC-SHA256 tokens required for writes
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Clinical writes blocked until a human confirms (HTTP 428); real-world actions (calls, SMS, forms) go further: `commit` only *submits*, and execution requires a **provably out-of-band** single-use approval the agent's own toolchain cannot satisfy
- **Tenant isolation** — Every query scoped to tenant, cross-tenant access blocked
- **Medical disclaimers** — Injected on all clinical resource reads
- **Compiled Truth** — Current state + append-only evidence trail for every resource

```text
AI Agent ──▶ MCP Server ──▶ Guardrail Proxy ──▶ Any FHIR Server
                              ↓                    (HAPI, Epic,
                         PHI redaction              Medplum, etc.)
                         Audit trail
                         Step-up auth
                         Human-in-the-loop
```

## Prove it: guardrail conformance

The guardrails are **verifiable, not marketing.** A runnable harness probes any
deployment with synthetic data and emits a scorecard across all seven properties —
run it against your own instance (or ours):

```bash
python scripts/guardrail_conformance.py \
  --base-url https://app.healthclaw.io --tenant desktop-demo \
  --step-up-token "$(mint a token via POST /r6/fhir/internal/step-up-token)"
```

```text
HealthClaw Guardrail Conformance — https://app.healthclaw.io [tenant=desktop-demo]
  Grade: A   (7/7 properties)
  [PASS] PHI Redaction            [PASS] Human-in-the-Loop
  [PASS] Immutable Audit Trail    [PASS] Tenant Isolation
  [PASS] Step-Up Authorization    [PASS] Medical Disclaimers
  [PASS] Error Fidelity — A (local-fhir-only)
```

Or hit the **one-URL self-test** on any running deployment — no token needed, it
self-tenants internally and returns 200 at Grade A (503 otherwise):

```bash
curl "https://app.healthclaw.io/r6/fhir/\$conformance?format=text"
```

The local FHIR profile is Grade A: unsupported local-search inputs are rejected
or reported according to `Prefer: handling`, and every failure path is audited.
The same harness runs against the Flask test client as a **CI baseline**
(`tests/test_guardrail_conformance.py`). `--json` emits a machine-readable
report; `--mcp-url` additionally grades MCP `tools/call` error signaling as a
separate profile. For an authenticated MCP deployment, set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` or
pass `--mcp-auth-token`. Library API:
`from r6.conformance import LiveProbeClient, ProbeContext, run_conformance`.

### What this grade means (and what it doesn't)

The grade covers the **HealthClaw guardrail layer only** — a self-test of the
seven properties against synthetic data it just created. It is **not** a HIPAA
Security Rule assessment, a third-party audit, or a penetration test of your
deployment: infrastructure, BAAs, encryption at rest/in transit, and access
controls remain the deployer's responsibility (see
[Known Limitations](#known-limitations)). Because the harness is
deployment-agnostic, a third party *can* run it against any instance as one
input to a real assessment — it does not substitute for one. The report states
this scope itself in every output format.

## Install as a Claude Plugin

HealthClaw ships as a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Two plugins are available:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add aks129/HealthClawGuardrails

# Install the FHIR guardrail plugin (this repo)
claude plugin install healthclaw-guardrails@healthclaw-marketplace

# Install the personal-health companion plugin (frozen — upstream archived)
claude plugin install smarthealthconnect@healthclaw-marketplace
```

| Plugin | Skills | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `healthclaw-guardrails` | curatr, fasten-connect, fhir-r6-guardrails, fhir-upstream-proxy, healthex-export, phi-redaction | [aks129/HealthClawGuardrails](https://github.com/aks129/HealthClawGuardrails) |
| `smarthealthconnect` | care-completion, diet-exercise, healthy-habits, kids-health, medication-refills, research-monitor | [aks129/SmartHealthConnect](https://github.com/aks129/SmartHealthConnect) *(archived — skills frozen at v1.2.0; live successors are CareAgents advisors)* |

Each skill is auto-discoverable — Claude loads it when your prompt matches the skill's trigger phrases (e.g. "check my care gaps", "redact this bundle", "run Curatr on my conditions").

**Not on Claude/MCP?** The same 28 guardrailed tools run on OpenAI, Gemini, LangChain, or plain HTTP via the framework-neutral bridge in [`adapters/`](adapters/) — see [Recipe: run HealthClaw tools on any agent framework](docs/recipes/any-agent-framework.md). Guardrails stay server-side, so no framework can bypass them.

All tools add `_mcp_summary` with reasoning, clinical context, and limitations.

## Guardrail Demo

The 6-step demo at `/r6/fhir/demo/agent-loop` shows the full guardrail sequence:

1. **PHI Redaction** — Agent reads a patient, receives redacted data
2. **$validate Gate** — Agent proposes an Observation, validated before write
3. **Permission Deny** — No Permission rule exists, access denied with reasoning
4. **Permission Permit** — Permit rule created, re-evaluation succeeds
5. **Step-up + Human-in-the-loop** — Write requires both token and human confirmation
6. **Commit + Audit** — Write succeeds, full audit trail generated

## Comparison

| Feature | This Project | AWS HealthLake MCP | Medplum MCP | Raw FHIR API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Works with any FHIR server | Yes | HealthLake only | Medplum only | N/A |
| PHI redaction on reads | Yes | No | No | No |
| Immutable audit trail | Yes | CloudTrail (separate) | Partial | No |
| Step-up auth for writes | Yes | IAM (separate) | Medplum auth | No |
| Human-in-the-loop | Yes | No | No | No |
| Permission $evaluate (R6) | Yes | No | No | No |
| Setup time | 10 seconds | 30+ minutes | 15+ minutes | Varies |

## FHIR Version Support

| Version | Profile | Status | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R4 | US Core v9 | **Stable** | Patient, Condition, AllergyIntolerance, Immunization, MedicationRequest, Procedure, DiagnosticReport, CarePlan, CareTeam, Goal, DocumentReference, Coverage, ServiceRequest, Location, Organization, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, RelatedPerson, Specimen, FamilyMemberHistory |
| R6 | v6.0.0-ballot3 | Experimental | Permission, SubscriptionTopic, DeviceAlert, NutritionIntake, DeviceAssociation, NutritionProduct, Requirements, ActorDefinition |

Both R4 and R6 resources flow through the same guardrail stack (PHI redaction, audit, step-up auth, tenant isolation). R6 ballot resources may change before final release.

## Testing

```bash
# Python tests (1,490+ across 90+ files; includes action-rail, SDC, quality, labs, ops, CareAgents suites)
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_r6_routes.py::test_name -v   # single test

# MCP server tests
cd services/agent-orchestrator && npm ci && npm test

# Playwright end-to-end tests (UI + API, requires Flask on :5000)
cd e2e && npm ci && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium && npm test
cd e2e && npm run test:headed    # headed browser
cd e2e && npm run test:ui        # interactive UI mode
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/r6/fhir/metadata` | GET | CapabilityStatement |
| `/r6/fhir/health` | GET | Liveness probe (reports upstream status) |
| `/r6/fhir/{type}` | POST | Create resource (requires step-up) |
| `/r6/fhir/{type}` | GET | Search resources |
| `/r6/fhir/{type}/{id}` | GET | Read resource (redacted) |
| `/r6/fhir/{type}/{id}` | PUT | Update resource (requires step-up + ETag) |
| `/r6/fhir/{type}/$validate` | POST | Validate resource |
| `/r6/fhir/Questionnaire[/{id}]/$populate` | POST | SDC — pre-fill a QuestionnaireResponse from a subject |
| `/r6/fhir/QuestionnaireResponse/$extract` | POST | SDC — extract a transaction Bundle (`?dryRun=true` to preview) |
| `/r6/fhir/{type}/{id}/$deidentify` | GET | Conservative de-identification preview (expert review required) |
| `/r6/fhir/Observation/$stats` | GET | Observation statistics |
| `/r6/fhir/Observation/$lastn` | GET | Most recent observations |
| `/r6/fhir/Permission/$evaluate` | POST | R6 access control evaluation |
| `/r6/fhir/SubscriptionTopic/$list` | GET | Subscription topic discovery |
| `/r6/fhir/Bundle/$ingest-context` | POST | Bundle ingestion + context envelope |
| `/r6/fhir/context/{id}` | GET | Retrieve context envelope |
| `/r6/fhir/AuditEvent` | GET | Search audit events |
| `/r6/fhir/AuditEvent/$export` | GET | Export audit trail (NDJSON/Bundle) |
| `/r6/fhir/demo/agent-loop` | POST | 6-step guardrail demo |

| `/r6/fhir/{type}/{id}/$curatr-evaluate` | GET | Evaluate resource data quality (Curatr) |
| `/r6/fhir/{type}/{id}/$curatr-apply-fix` | POST | Apply patient-approved fixes with Provenance |

Local search accepts the parameters advertised by `/r6/fhir/metadata`.
Unknown parameters default to lenient handling (a bounded
`search.mode="outcome"` warning); `Prefer: handling=strict` returns a 400
`OperationOutcome`. Unsupported modifiers and malformed supported values always
return 400. `_count=0` and `_summary=count` are count-only searches. Self links
contain exactly the applied, URL-encoded parameters, and audit output never
echoes submitted filter values or arbitrary parameter names.

## Upstream Proxy

Connect to real FHIR servers while keeping all guardrails active:

```bash
FHIR_UPSTREAM_URL=https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4 python main.py
```

- **Reads**: Fetched from upstream, then redacted + audited + disclaimers added
- **Searches**: Forwarded with all query params, results redacted per entry
- **Writes**: Validated locally first, then forwarded with step-up auth check
- **URL rewriting**: Upstream URLs never leak to clients

Tested with: HAPI FHIR R4/R5, SMART Health IT, Epic Sandbox.

**Put the guardrails in front of your FHIR server** — recipe for running the
redaction + audit + step-up + human-in-the-loop stack in front of **Medplum**
(the same pattern works for Aidbox, Google Cloud Healthcare, or any FHIR R4
server): [docs/recipes/healthclaw-in-front-of-medplum.md](docs/recipes/healthclaw-in-front-of-medplum.md).
A repeatable integration test (`tests/test_medplum_in_front.py`) proves a
Medplum-returned Patient comes back redacted + audited and writes are step-up
gated before reaching Medplum.

## Curatr — Patient-Owned Data Quality

Curatr is a patient-facing data quality skill that evaluates FHIR health records for
coding issues and lets the patient decide how to resolve them.

```text
1. Patient connects data → HealthClaw Guardrails deidentifies and loads it
2. OpenClaw calls curatr.evaluate → checks codes against live terminology APIs
3. Issues presented in plain language with impact and fix suggestions
4. Patient approves fixes → curatr.apply_fix updates resource + creates Provenance
5. Optional: generate a structured correction request for the source provider
```

**What Curatr checks on a Condition:**

| Check | Service | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deprecated code system | Local lookup (no network) | ICD-9-CM → critical |
| ICD-10-CM code validity | NLM Clinical Tables API | Invalid code → warning |
| SNOMED CT / LOINC validity | tx.fhir.org (HL7 public) | Unknown code → warning |
| RxNorm drug code | RXNAV API (NLM) | Missing RXCUI → warning |
| Display name accuracy | Cross-checked with canonical term | Mismatch → suggestion |
| Missing required fields | Structural | No clinicalStatus → warning |

Every fix creates a linked **Provenance** resource recording patient intent, field
changes, and agent attribution. All changes are audited in the immutable trail.

**OpenClaw skill:** `skills/curatr/SKILL.md`

## SMART Health Links (Kill the Clipboard)

Patient-controlled encrypted record sharing via QR code, implemented on top of
**[jmandel/kill-the-clipboard-skill](https://github.com/jmandel/kill-the-clipboard-skill)**
(MIT, pinned `fa0020d`) — credit Josh Mandel. HealthClaw governs what enters the
bundle (step-up auth, profiles, guardrails, audit trail); KTC governs sharing
(zero-knowledge server-side storage, SHL STU 1 protocol, revocation, in-browser
viewer).

**What it does:** The `shl_generate` MCP tool (Write group, step-up required)
fetches the patient's guardrailed FHIR bundle, encrypts it client-side in the MCP
server (the SHL server never sees plaintext), uploads ciphertext, and returns:

- `shlink` — the `shlink:/` URI to encode in a QR (an encrypted pointer, not data)
- `viewer_link` — browser URL for clinic staff
- `manage_link` — patient-only revocation + access-log URL

**Security:** The QR encodes only the encrypted pointer. PHI never appears in the
QR image. The SHL server stores only ciphertext + `sha256(auth_token)`. Persona
hard rule: see `skills/share-health-qr/SKILL.md` — never direct-encode PHI into
QR images (incident 2026-06-12).

### Quick Start (local)

```bash
# Start the SHL storage server (profile `shl`)
docker-compose --profile shl up -d

# Tell the MCP server where the SHL server lives
# Add to services/agent-orchestrator/.env or export:
export SHL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Without `SHL_SERVER_URL`, `shl_generate` returns an explicit simulation stub
(`simulated: true`) — never a fake link.

### Railway Deploy

```bash
# 1. Add the SHL service
railway add --service shl-server

# 2. Attach a persistent volume (SQLite lives here)
railway service shl-server && railway volume add --mount-path /data

# 3. Configure the SHL server
railway variables --service shl-server \
  --set BASE_URL=<public-url-of-shl-server> \
  --set DB_PATH=/data/db.sqlite

# 4. Expose a public domain
railway domain --service shl-server

# 5. Deploy — MUST run from the shl-server directory
cd services/shl-server && railway up --service shl-server

# 6. Wire the MCP server to the SHL server
railway variables --service mcp-server \
  --set SHL_SERVER_URL=<public-url-of-shl-server>
```

> **Caveat 1 — deploy from the right directory:** The repo-root `railway.toml`
> targets the Flask Dockerfile. If you run `railway up --service shl-server`
> from the repo root, Railway uses the wrong Dockerfile and the deploy fails.
> Always `cd services/shl-server` first — that directory has its own
> `railway.toml` that points to the correct image.
>
> **Caveat 2 — watchPatterns skip:** A service that inherited `watchPatterns`
> from the root config may silently skip Dockerfile-only deploys (no source
> file changes detected). The per-service `railway.toml` in `services/shl-server/`
> overrides this after the first successful build. If deploys are skipped, force
> one with `railway up --service shl-server` from the shl-server directory.
>
> **Caveat 3 — simulation mode:** Without `SHL_SERVER_URL` on the MCP server,
> `shl_generate` returns `{ simulated: true, note: "SHL_SERVER_URL not
> configured — returned stub." }`. Personas surface this note verbatim and
> never improvise an alternative.

| `STEP_UP_SECRET` | Production | — | HMAC-SHA256 signing secret |
| `FHIR_UPSTREAM_URL` | No | — | Upstream FHIR server (enables proxy mode) |
| `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` | Production | `sqlite:///mcp_server.db` | Database connection |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | No | (dev key) | Flask session secret |
| `READ_AUTH_ENABLED` | Production | `false` | Require tenant-bound credentials on protected reads |
| `PUBLIC_TENANTS` | Production | — | Explicit comma-separated synthetic/demo tenant allowlist |

Database DDL is never run during WSGI import. Run `flask --app main init-db`
before each release; it applies the locked Alembic revisions. Operators adopting
Alembic on an existing v1.8.0 Postgres deployment must follow the
[database migration runbook](docs/runbooks/database-migrations.md) to verify and
stamp the compatibility baseline before upgrading.

## Personal FHIR data store — patient import flow

This walkthrough shows how to go from a raw HealthEx export to querying your
own records through Claude Code's MCP tools.

### 1. Start the stack

```bash
uv sync
uv run python main.py                         # Flask on :5000
cd services/agent-orchestrator && npm ci && npm start  # MCP on :3001
```

### 2. Import your HealthEx / Flexpa / generic FHIR bundle

```bash
# Dry-run first to preview without writing
python scripts/import_healthex.py \
  --bundle-file ~/Downloads/my-records.json \
  --dry-run

# Real import — prints context_id on success
python scripts/import_healthex.py \
  --bundle-file ~/Downloads/my-records.json \
  --tenant-id my-patient \
  --step-up-secret "$STEP_UP_SECRET"
```

### 3. Connect Claude Code via MCP

`.mcp.json` in this repo auto-configures Claude Code when you open the project.
Update `X-Tenant-ID` to match your `--tenant-id`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "healthclaw-local": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Tenant-ID": "my-patient" }
    }
  }
}
```

Then in Claude Code:

```text
Use fhir_search to find all my Conditions
Use context_get with context_id <ctx-id> to get my full context envelope
Use curatr_evaluate on Condition/<id> to check data quality
```

### 4. Set up Fasten Connect (optional)

```bash
# .env additions
FASTEN_PUBLIC_KEY=<key>
FASTEN_PRIVATE_KEY=<key>
FASTEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<secret>
FASTEN_CURATR_SCAN=true    # auto-run Curatr after each import
```

Records arrive via webhook at `/r6/fasten/webhook` and are stored under the
patient's canonical tenant ID.

### 5. Deidentify for sharing

```bash
# De-identification preview (not a legal Safe Harbor determination)
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: my-patient" \
  http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/Patient/pt-1/\$deidentify

# Patient-controlled (preserves birthDate, strips institutional identifiers)
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: my-patient" \
  "http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/Patient/pt-1/\$deidentify?mode=patient-controlled&patient_id=my-patient"
```

### 6. Telegram bot (optional)

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token> TENANT_ID=my-patient \
FHIR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir \
python openclaw/bot.py
```

Commands: `/health`, `/conditions`, `/labs`, `/curatr`, `/curatr fix`, `/approve`.

Or via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose --profile openclaw up -d
```

### 7. Use Medplum as the backing FHIR store (optional)

Set in `.env` (leave `FHIR_UPSTREAM_URL` empty):

```bash
MEDPLUM_BASE_URL=https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4
MEDPLUM_CLIENT_ID=<id>
MEDPLUM_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
```

All guardrails apply to Medplum responses identically to local SQLite mode.
Access tokens are cached in Redis (key `medplum:access_token`; falls back to
in-process cache when Redis is unavailable).

## Known Limitations

- **The conformance grade is a self-test of the guardrail layer, not a HIPAA
  assessment or third-party audit** — see
  [What this grade means](#what-this-grade-means-and-what-it-doesnt)
- Local mode: JSON blob storage with table-scan search (no indexed fields)
- **Redaction is HIPAA Safe-Harbor-*style* field redaction** (demographics), **not Expert Determination**. It's a compensating control that removes identifier-class fields; it is not a legal de-identification determination. Production de-id rigor (profile-specific recursive allowlists, an Expert-Determination path) is on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) ([#112](../../issues/112)).
- **Validation is structural**, not full StructureDefinition/profile conformance or terminology binding. What's demonstrated is the guardrail *contract* (redact + audit + step-up + human-confirm + tenant isolation + error fidelity), not production validation depth — that's tracked in [#112](../../issues/112).
- SubscriptionTopic stored but notifications not dispatched
- Clinical FHIR writes gate human-in-the-loop with a header flag (`X-Human-Confirmed`), not cryptographic confirmation — a compensating control for the demo, not proof a human acted. Real-world actions (phone/SMS/etc.) no longer use that header: `commit` only submits the action for out-of-band approval (202 `awaiting_confirmation`), and the patient's Approve tap consumes a single-use `ActionConfirmation` credential server-side before anything executes.
- OAuth endpoints are for discovery/SMART advertisement; route enforcement is via step-up + read-auth tokens, and the auto-approve authorize flow is limited to public/demo tenants (no per-user consent screen)
- No historical versioning (version_id increments but old versions not retrievable)
- Upstream proxy: no response caching, no cross-version translation
- **Security is config-dependent — production requires** `READ_AUTH_ENABLED=true` (authenticate non-public reads), `INTERNAL_TOKEN_MINT_SECRET` (gate token mint/seed for non-public tenants; fail-closed in prod when unset), `PUBLIC_TENANTS` limited to synthetic demo tenants, a real `SESSION_SECRET`/`STEP_UP_SECRET`, and https-only upstreams
- Step-up tokens are valid for multiple writes within their 5-min TTL (not single-use); irreversible actions rely on state-machine idempotency (guarded `WHERE status='proposed'` claim) rather than nonce consumption

## Contributing — this is a community effort

HealthClaw Guardrails is developed in the open as a shared reference, not a commercial product.
The guardrail layer between AI agents and clinical data only gets trustworthy if a lot of people
with different vantage points pressure-test it. We especially want:

- **Implementers** building FHIR × MCP integrations — tell us where the patterns break in the real world.
- **Clinicians & compliance folks** — challenge the redaction profiles, audit model, and the documented HIPAA postures.
- **Standards people** (HL7 / SDC / SMART) — tell us where we've diverged from the spec, especially on `$populate`/`$extract`.
- **Anyone** — open an issue, file a "you got this wrong," or send a PR.
