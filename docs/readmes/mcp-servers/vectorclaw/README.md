**Give your AI assistant a body.**

VectorClaw is an MCP server that exposes [Anki Vector](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod) robot capabilities as tools for AI assistants like OpenClaw — bridging natural language to real-world robot actions over a fully local, cloud-free stack.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐    stdio MCP    ┌──────────────────┐    gRPC/WiFi    ┌─────────┐
│  AI Agent   │ ─────────────── │  vectorclaw-mcp  │ ─────────────── │  Vector │
│  (OpenClaw) │                 │  (Python 3.11+)  │                 │  Robot  │
└─────────────┘                 └──────────────────┘                 └─────────┘
```

All communication is **local-only** — no cloud dependency at runtime (Wire-Pod setup path).

## Current Status

> **v1.0.0 Released** · 2026-03-01

**16 tools verified ✅** on hardware | **7 tools experimental ⚠️**

**Known limitations:**
- `vector_drive_on_charger` — activates cube but no reliable charger approach
- Perception detections — often returns empty lists; SDK semantics under investigation
- Idle behaviors — Vector's autonomous animations can overlap with commanded behaviors

See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the full milestone plan.

---

## Quickstart

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+ · [Wire-Pod](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod) running · Vector on local WiFi

> For the complete walkthrough (Wire-Pod install, robot auth, WiFi config, troubleshooting) see **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

### Guided Setup (recommended for new users)

The `vectorclaw-setup` wizard handles configuration, SDK validation, connectivity
check, and a smoke test in one go:

```bash
pip install vectorclaw-mcp
vectorclaw-setup
```

You will be prompted for your robot's serial number and optional IP address.
On success you'll see a clear **SETUP PASSED** message and the next-steps command.
On failure every step includes an exact remediation hint.

See **[docs/OPENCLAW_SETUP_SKILL.md](docs/OPENCLAW_SETUP_SKILL.md)** for full details.

---

### Manual Setup

**Step 1 — Install VectorClaw**

```bash
pip install vectorclaw-mcp
```

**Step 2 — Configure Vector SDK**

[Wire-Pod](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod) is the canonical self-hosted server for Vector.
Install the SDK distribution and run the one-time auth wizard:

```bash
pip install wirepod_vector_sdk
python -m anki_vector.configure
```

> **Note:** `wirepod_vector_sdk` installs under the `anki_vector` Python namespace, so all imports and CLI commands use `anki_vector`.

<details>
<summary>Legacy cloud path (best-effort only)</summary>

The standalone `anki_vector` package requires working DDL cloud servers and is brittle on modern Python runtimes.

```bash
pip install "vectorclaw-mcp[legacy]"
python -m anki_vector.configure
```

Prefer `wirepod_vector_sdk` for reliable, cloud-independent operation.
</details>

**Step 3 — Set environment variables**

```bash
export VECTOR_SERIAL="your-robot-serial"   # required — printed on underside of robot
export VECTOR_HOST="192.168.x.x"           # optional — auto-discovered if omitted
```

**Step 4 — Run the server**

```bash
vectorclaw-mcp
# or
python -m vectorclaw_mcp
```

---

## MCP Client Configuration

Add the following block to your `mcporter.json` (or equivalent MCP client config).

**With `uvx`** *(recommended — no prior install needed)*

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vectorclaw": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["vectorclaw-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "VECTOR_SERIAL": "your-serial-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**With `pip install`** *(if installed locally)*

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vectorclaw": {
      "command": "vectorclaw-mcp",
      "env": {
        "VECTOR_SERIAL": "your-serial-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Contributing

1. 🌿 **Branch:** branch off `dev`, use `<type>/<short-description>` naming (e.g. `fix/vector-face-payload`, `feat/vector-scan`)
2. 🧪 **Tests:** add or update tests under `tests/`; all tests use the mocked SDK — no hardware required
3. ✅ **CI:** Python 3.11 is required and must pass; Python 3.12 is experimental/informational — run `pytest tests/ -v` locally before opening a PR
4. 🤖 **Hardware:** if your change touches a tool or connection layer, record a smoke-test run in [Hardware Smoke Log](docs/HARDWARE_SMOKE_LOG.md) following the [Hardware Test Playbook](docs/HARDWARE_TEST_PLAYBOOK.md)
5. 🎯 **PR scope:** keep PRs focused — separate docs, feature, and refactor changes to reduce merge-conflict risk with parallel lanes
