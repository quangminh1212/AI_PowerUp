Local Core AI inference server for Apple silicon — private, on-device LLMs behind OpenAI- and
Anthropic-compatible APIs. Free and open, no paywall.

> **Beta.** caix depends on Apple's beta **Core AI** runtime. Expect breakage across macOS/Xcode
> beta lines. Inference is local; downloads still use the network.

caix serves Core AI `.aimodel` language bundles on Apple silicon (Neural Engine + GPU). It exposes:

- a **web dashboard** for machine stats, model management, and live usage,
- a **chat** view with markdown, streaming, tools, skills, and MCP,
- **OpenAI-compatible** (`/v1/chat/completions`) and **Anthropic-compatible** (`/v1/messages`) APIs.

OpenAI and Anthropic clients can point at the local server.

caix supports classic speculative packages and EAGLE target+draft packages. Use the model-card flags
for each package.

Multimodal: caix runs **multimodal Gemma 4** bundles — send an image with your prompt and the model
describes and reasons over it (verified on-device; image + text). Audio and video content blocks are
parsed but not yet consumed and return a clear 400.

---

## Testing and support

caix is free and open. No paywall.

Benchmark procedure is in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) and [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

Support conversions, benchmark time, hosting, and tester access:
[redhillsmediafl.com/open-source](https://redhillsmediafl.com/open-source).

Support is optional and never gates features.

---

## Performance

No public speed table is current.

Benchmark rules and raw-log requirements are in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md). Do not
publish speed numbers without the raw run directory, exact model repo revision, caix commit,
hardware, OS build, and exact command.

Planned work is tracked in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
The dry-run staged-execution planner surface is documented in [docs/CLUSTER.md](docs/CLUSTER.md).

---

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mac** | Apple silicon (M1 or newer). Unified memory limits model size. A 26B 4-bit model needs ~20 GB free. |
| **macOS** | macOS 27 beta, or another beta line that ships Apple's Core AI runtime. |
| **Xcode** | Matching Core AI-capable Xcode beta with `swift` and `CoreAI.framework`. |
| **Disk** | A few GB for the build + the size of each model (e.g. ~13 GB for the 26B 4-bit bundle). |
| **Internet** | The build fetches Swift packages. Model downloads use the network. Inference is offline. |

caix links directly against Core AI. The OS, Xcode, and `apple/coreai-models` revision need to match
the active beta line. Stable toolchain support waits on stable Core AI.

Swift Package Manager fetches the HTTP server, tokenizer, and other dependencies. No manual
third-party installs.

---

## Install

### Option A — Homebrew

Homebrew is the intended default install path after tap testing and Core AI stabilization.

Current beta path:

```bash
brew install redhillsmediafl/caix/caix
caix doctor
```

After macOS 27/Core AI are stable and the release formula passes audit/test:

```bash
brew tap RedHillsMediaFL/caix
brew install caix
caix doctor
```

Homebrew/core comes later. See [Homebrew notes](docs/HOMEBREW.md).
Releases stay below `1.0.0` while Core AI is beta; see [release notes](docs/RELEASES.md).

### Option B — source install

Requires the Core AI-capable macOS/Xcode beta from [Requirements](#requirements):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHillsMediaFL/caix/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This clones or updates `~/caix`, builds the Core AI runtime binary, and links the `caix` launcher into
`~/.local/bin` when possible.

### Option C — download a prebuilt binary

1. Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/redhillsmediafl/caix/releases) page and download
   `caix-<version>-macos-arm64.tar.gz`.
2. Extract and run:

```bash
tar -xzf caix-*-macos-arm64.tar.gz
cd caix-*-macos-arm64
./caix serve
```

The first downloaded run may be blocked by macOS Gatekeeper. Allow it once:
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway"**, or:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./bin/caix
```

> The prebuilt binary needs a Mac whose macOS includes the matching **Core AI** runtime (same beta
> line it was built against). If it won't launch (`CoreAI.framework` load error), use Option D.

### Option D — build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhillsmediafl/caix.git
cd caix
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app    # your Core AI–capable Xcode (once)
./scripts/install.sh                                 # = COREAI_RUNTIME=1 swift build -c release
```

The first build downloads Swift dependencies and compiles. It takes a few minutes.

> **Core AI dependency (beta).** Runtime builds track `apple/coreai-models` on `main` so caix follows
> Apple's active Core AI work. `Package.resolved` records the exact SHA used by each checkout; keep
> that SHA in benchmark and release evidence, and snapshot a known-good revision for a release train
> if upstream `main` regresses.

---

## Get a model

caix serves Core AI `.aimodel` bundles. Get one of these two ways:

**A. Download a converted bundle.** The default install path is `~/.caix/models/exports`:

```bash
# list converted Qwen repos and exact install commands
caix catalog redhillsmediafl/qwen
# prompt through families and models, then download:
caix catalog install
# or install one repo directly:
caix catalog install redhillsmediafl/rhm-qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-caix
```

`caix catalog install` wraps `hf download`, uses local Hugging Face credentials/cache when present,
and runs a disk preflight first.

### Model catalog

Converted bundles are in the [redhillsmediafl Hugging Face org](https://huggingface.co/redhillsmediafl?search=caix)
and in family collections:

- [Qwen3](https://huggingface.co/collections/redhillsmediafl/qwen-caix-6a3fd5f6d272c154dbfcda67) · [Qwen2.5](https://huggingface.co/collections/redhillsmediafl/qwen25-caix-6a49cb984626eb049898ef2f)
- [Gemma 4](https://huggingface.co/collections/redhillsmediafl/gemma-caix-6a3fd5f57b67589b85e6eac6) — multimodal (image + text)
- [GLM](https://huggingface.co/collections/redhillsmediafl/glm-caix-6a40604dfb87315cc99a558e) · [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/collections/redhillsmediafl/mistral-caix-6a404e43a972c2f2621a000e) · [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/collections/redhillsmediafl/mixtral-caix-6a49cb9a1c5fc6899c1334d8)
- [gpt-oss](https://huggingface.co/collections/redhillsmediafl/gpt-oss-caix-6a404e428791003d8e6e79fc)

Use the catalog for current install commands:

```bash
caix catalog redhillsmediafl
caix catalog redhillsmediafl/qwen
caix catalog install <repo>
```

Model cards list exact revisions, licenses, storage, RAM notes, and any speculative or EAGLE flags.
Catalog entries are published only when they are backed by open-source/open-weight models and either
have runtime verification, or are converted artifacts that our current hardware cannot fully smoke.
Those cards must say what passed and what still needs tester hardware. Blocked and component-only
packages must be labeled that way.

To submit a model or tester result, see [docs/CATALOG_SUBMISSIONS.md](docs/CATALOG_SUBMISSIONS.md).

**B. Convert a bundle.** See [Converting models](#converting-models-advanced).

A bundle is a folder containing a `*.aimodel/` directory, `metadata.json`, and `tokenizer/`. Drop it
under `models/exports/` and caix will list it.

---

## Run

```bash
caix serve
caix dashboard
caix chat
```

From a source checkout, `./caix serve` also works.

Open:

- **http://localhost:1237** — the dashboard (machine stats, models, live usage)
- **http://localhost:1237/chat** — the chat view (markdown, streaming, tools, skills, MCP)

`caix serve` prewarms the smallest chat-suitable installed model before it starts listening. Use
`--prewarm <model|all|off>` or `--no-prewarm` to override.

For OpenAI-compatible clients, use `http://localhost:1237/v1` with any API key:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1237/v1/chat/completions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "<your-model-name>",
  "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]
}'
```

### OpenCode

The repo includes `opencode.json` with a local `caix` OpenAI-compatible provider pointed at
`http://127.0.0.1:1237/v1` and known RHM/caix model IDs. Copy or symlink it into
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, start caix, then verify OpenCode can see the provider:

```bash
opencode models caix
```

OpenCode reads the static provider map; the live server list is the source of truth for installed
bundles:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:1237/v1/models
```

When OpenCode sends an installed model ID to `/v1/chat/completions`, caix hot-loads the matching
local bundle from the exports directory. If the ID is not installed yet, use the dashboard's RHM
installer or `caix catalog install` to add the converted bundle first.

### Other devices

caix binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. To reach it from other devices, put it behind
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com):

```bash
tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:1237
```

This gives you a private HTTPS URL on your tailnet without opening public ports.

## What is included

- Core AI inference on Neural Engine + GPU. This is not llama.cpp or MLX.
- MTP/speculative decoding for supported pairs; caix auto-tunes the draft window up to the safe cap.
- Dashboard: RAM/GPU stats, load/unload/convert/delete, per-model usage, rolling/lifetime tok/s.
  Usage stats persist across restarts.
- Chat: markdown, streaming, code blocks with copy, tables, and a reasoning panel when a model emits
  `reasoning_content`. The chat page includes a redacted session log for debugging.
- Terminal chat: `caix chat` / `caix tui` talks to a local caix server and includes shell-tool
  controls (`ask`, `on`, `off`).
- Skills: choose or write a system prompt.
- Tools: built-in `calculator`, `clock`, and `fetch_url`. Use qwen-family models for tool-heavy
  chats; the gemma MTP model is weak at tool calls.
- MCP: connect a streamable-HTTP MCP server and use its tools in chat.
- APIs: OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`) and Anthropic (`/v1/messages`), streaming.
- UI model management: download and convert from a Hugging Face repo. New architectures are flagged
  with the Core AI authoring work they need.

---

## Known limitations

- **Beta toolchain required.** See [Requirements](#requirements).
- **Cold loads are slow.** Core AI compiles the model before first use (~30-60 s for a 13 GB model).
  `caix serve` prewarms by default; `--no-prewarm` accepts traffic immediately.
- **Server fast path.** Standard language bundles use Apple's kept-hot CoreAILanguageModels engine
  by default after `/api/load`. `COREAI_LEGACY_ENGINE=1` uses the older sequential path for
  debugging. Hybrid qwen3_5/qwen3_5_moe bundles with packed recurrent state use the explicit Core
  AI sequential engine unless `COREAI_FAST_HYBRID_ENGINE=1` is set; the current fast warmup cache
  shape is too small for those fixed state prefixes.
- **Background services and external volumes.** If you run caix from a `launchd` agent, Apple's
  loader needs file-access permission and cannot read external/USB volumes without it. Keep the
  binary and models on the internal disk, or run `caix serve` from a normal user session. Full Disk
  Access on the binary fixes the `launchd` case. If exports stay on an external SSD, generate a
  local model-list index and pass it via `caix_export_index`:

```bash
scripts/refresh-export-index.sh /Volumes/SSD/ai-dev/coreai-pipeline/exports \
  ~/coreai-server/export-index.json
```

- **Greedy tool-calling.** The MTP/speculative path is greedy, so lower-parameter models may not
  reliably emit tool calls. Use a qwen-family model for tool-heavy chats.
- **Authored architectures.** Conversion support exists for gemma3/gemma4,
  qwen2/qwen3/qwen3_moe/qwen3_5/qwen3_5_moe, glm4, mistral, mixtral, and gpt_oss. New model types
  are flagged with their required Core AI authoring steps in the UI and support logs.
- **Ornith-1.0-35B lane.** `ornith-1.0-35b` is registered for local conversion. The authored int4
  path exports a 17 GB bundle, but runtime warmup is blocked by an MPS reshape failure, so it is not
  published to HF. The next fix is graph segmentation or a decode-shape workaround. The 397B variant
  uses the same authored `qwen3_5_moe` path and needs the full 122-shard source download first.
- **Diffusion models** are not in this beta.

---

## Converting models (advanced)

Conversion wraps Apple's `coreai.llm.export` and needs Apple's `coreai-models` Python checkout and
[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
# point caix at your coreai-models python dir and keep conversion IO on the SSD:
export caix_coreai_models=/path/to/coreai-models/python
export HF_HOME=${HF_HOME:-/Volumes/SSD/hf-cache}
export caix_tmpdir=${caix_tmpdir:-/Volumes/SSD/coreai-tmp}
export caix_exports=${caix_exports:-$PWD/models/exports}
scripts/check-disk-pressure.sh --path /Volumes/SSD --floor-gib 500

# check support, then convert:
python3 python/converter/convert.py --check --hf-id Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B
python3 python/converter/convert.py --hf-id Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B --compression 4bit --compute-precision float16
```

Run only one heavy Core AI export, HF transfer, CLI verification, build, or benchmark at a time.
For local queues, gate each job with:

```bash
scripts/conversion-guard.sh --wait
```

Dashboard path: paste a HF repo in **Add model → HuggingFace → Core AI**, pick
compression/precision, and click Convert. New architectures are flagged with the required authoring
work.

### GGUF repos (llama.cpp models)

caix can convert GGUF repos. If a repo ships only `.gguf` files, caix dequantizes the GGUF back to
an HF checkpoint, then runs the normal export.

```bash
# repo: caix picks the least-compressed quant present (F16 > Q8_0 > Q6_K > ...)
python3 python/converter/convert.py --gguf unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF --name qwen3-0.6b-coreai
# or pin a specific file:
python3 python/converter/convert.py --gguf unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF --gguf-file Qwen3-0.6B-BF16.gguf
```

Dashboard path: paste a GGUF-only repo. It is routed through the dequant step; the support check
confirms the architecture after dequant.

> **Quality caveat.** A GGUF is already quantized. Dequantizing and re-exporting, often to 4-bit, is
> quant-on-quant and loses quality versus converting the original safetensors. Prefer the original
> release when it exists. GGUF does not add architecture support.
> Needs `gguf>=0.10.0` (added automatically for the dequant run). Note: `gemma4` GGUFs are **not**
> convertible — `transformers` has no GGUF dequantizer for that architecture yet.

---

## Paths

| | |
|---|---|
| Models | `~/.caix/models/exports/<name>/` (override with `caix_exports` or `--exports`) |
| HF cache | `$HF_HOME`; otherwise Hugging Face uses its local default |
| Converter tmp | `$caix_tmpdir`; converter default is `/Volumes/SSD/coreai-tmp` |
| Export index | optional JSON from `scripts/refresh-export-index.sh` (set `caix_export_index`) |
| Web UI | `web/` (served at `/` and `/chat`; restart `caix serve` after editing these files) |
| Usage stats | `~/.caix/usage.json` (override with `--stats-file`) — survives restarts |
| Converter | `python/converter/` |

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`swift: command not found`** → install Xcode (beta) and `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app`.
- **Build fails fetching `coreai-models`** → that package requires your Core AI–capable Xcode; confirm
  `xcode-select -p` points at it.
- **`/v1` returns 503** → the binary was built **without** the runtime. Rebuild with
  `COREAI_RUNTIME=1 swift build -c release` (the `./caix` launcher and `install.sh` do this for you).
- **No models listed** → put a bundle under `models/exports/` (a folder with a `*.aimodel/` inside).
- **First message hangs ~1 min** → expected on cold load; watch the spinner.
