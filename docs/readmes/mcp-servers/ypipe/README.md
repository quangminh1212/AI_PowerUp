[**Y̊pipe**](https://ypipe.com) is an easy-to-use local AI client and MCP orchestration engine—a secure, **local desktop application** that makes offline AI practical. Run optimized models (CPU/GPU) on your own hardware with absolute data sovereignty and zero cloud dependencies. Chain specialized models via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and bind them to on-premise systems to execute secure, autonomous workflows.

> **Note:** Y̊pipe is the successor to **Data-Philter**. The legacy Data-Philter documentation and codebase are archived in [archive/data-philter/README.md](archive/data-philter/README.md).

The key goals of this project are: **Easy-to-use local AI, Data Sovereignty, Multi-Agent Systems, and Java-native stability - all on consumer enterprise hardware.**

In the 2026 AI landscape, Ypipe acts as the **Industrial Assembly Line** for local AI.

## <img src="assets/watermill.svg" width="32" style="filter: invert(100%); vertical-align: middle;">  Why Ypipe?
Most AI tools are built for "Chat." Ypipe is built for **Data Workflows.** Ypipe targets connections to your system, your local secrets, and running on small devices.

---

### <img src="assets/aqueduct.svg" width="32" style="filter: invert(100%); vertical-align: middle;"> Key Differentiators:
* **Our goal is simple AI:** We focus on ensuring that you do not need a doctorate to get a model and data docking running. We believe local AI needs to be accessible to everyone.
* **The Intelligence Switchboard:** Don't waste a 70B model on a 1B task. Ypipe lets you easily select models for sub-tasks. Imagine simple jobs utilizing tiny models for OCR or classification while reserving heavy compute for final synthesis. What works on your computer also runs easily on a server - this is how one gets AI into productive use.
* **Built for the Professional Environment:** Ypipe uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and standardized APIs to bridge local intelligence with your existing tools. Whether it's a local SQL database or a custom enterprise API, Ypipe provides the "dock" for your data.
* **Java-Native Stability:** No Python dependency hell. Ypipe is built on Java, fitting seamlessly into existing enterprise server architectures, high-security environments, and professional DevOps pipelines. The dependencies that are required for the outside world: Do not worry, Ypipe manages it.
* **Sovereign Geopatriation:** 100% of the data stays on your hardware. No cloud-routing, no data leaks, and zero external API costs. You own the infrastructure and the intelligence it produces.

## <img src="assets/water-pump.svg" width="32" style="filter: invert(100%); vertical-align: middle;"> Features

*   **Autonomous Agent Chains:** Orchestrate multiple local models to perform complex, multi-step tasks without human intervention.
*   **Semantic Continuity:** Preserves context throughout the pipeline, ensuring that specialized agents have the "full picture" of the workflow.
*   **Cross-Platform UI & Headless:** Run it with a full GUI on Windows/macOS/Linux or deploy it as a headless background service for automated enterprise logging and plausibility checks.
*   **OpenAI Compatibility:** Drop-in replacement for OpenAI-based tools—just redirect the base URL to your local Ypipe instance.

### <img src="assets/fire-hydrant.svg" width="32" style="filter: invert(100%); vertical-align: middle;"> Choosing Your AI Model

Ypipe removes the guesswork from local AI. You don't need to be a data scientist to select the right intelligence; Ypipe acts as a **Model Switchboard**, ensuring you use the most efficient engine for every specific task in your pipeline.

Ypipe features a built-in **Gearbox** that automatically assesses your local hardware (CPU, GPU, and RAM) and suggests appropriate models. Further, it auto-selects the best runtime for your hardware to run the models locally—ensuring that you do not need to deal with the complexity of local AI configuration.

---

## <img src="assets/tap.svg" width="32" style="filter: invert(100%); vertical-align: middle;"> One-Click Connectivity

Ypipe is built to be the universal docking station for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. We have eliminated the "dependency hell" of manual installations.

*   **Zero-Dependency Setup:** One-click installation of MCP servers. Ypipe handles the environment, runtimes, and connections—no additional software or Python dependencies are required on your host machine.
*   **Built-in Specialized Servers:** Ypipe ships with a curated set of pre-defined MCP servers (including our own **Druid MCP Server**) for immediate enterprise utility. For community MCP servers, all MCP server definitions with NPX, UV, and JBang are supported.
*   **Community Expansion:** Effortlessly import any community-developed MCP server to instantly grant your local agents new capabilities, from database access to web-search tools.
*   **Intelligent Orchestration:** Ypipe doesn't just connect to MCP servers; it orchestrates them. It dynamically routes tasks to the specific models and MCP tools required at exactly the right moment in the pipeline.

## 🗲 Evolution & Vision

Ypipe operates on a **Continuous Release Stream**. Rather than waiting for static version milestones, we deploy incremental enhancements to the orchestration engine as the local AI landscape evolves. Our development is focused on the **industrialization of the "Last Mile"** of AI deployment.

### <img src="assets/rain.svg" width="32" style="filter: invert(100%); vertical-align: middle;">Current Strategic Focus:
*   **Agentic Gearbox Optimization:** Refining the "Model Switchboard" logic to further reduce latency and compute costs by routing tasks to the most efficient small models.
*   **Sovereign Connectivity:** Expanding the library of pre-defined enterprise "Docks" (SAP, internal SQL dialects, and legacy ERP systems).
*   **Contextual Integrity:** Enhancing the Semantic Reattachment engine to handle increasingly massive document hierarchies without context drift.
*   **Governance Layering:** Hardening the headless audit-log systems for high-compliance environments (Finance, Healthcare, and Defense).

### 🌈 The Vision:
We don't follow a fixed feature-path; we respond to the needs of the **Sovereign Enterprise**. Our goal is to ensure that Ypipe remains the most stable, Java-native bridge between raw local models and production-ready business value.

> *Note: Feature requests and architectural challenges from our [Consulting Partners](mailto:contact@iunera.com) directly prioritize the release stream.*
