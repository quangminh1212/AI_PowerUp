**Crack the egg. Hatch better agents.**

hatch3r is an open-source CLI and editor plugin (Claude Code + Cursor) that installs a tool-agnostic agentic coding setup into any repository. Audited each release across 24 governance domains and generated for 3 platform adapters (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot). One command gives you the full set of agents, skills, rules, commands, hooks, and MCP integrations -- optimized for your coding tool of choice (live counts in [`governance/inventory.json`](governance/inventory.json) <!-- counts auto-derived; see governance/inventory.json -->). Selective init installs only what you need based on your project type and team size.

> **v1.9.0 scope cut:** As of 1.9.0 hatch3r supports only Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Twelve adapters were removed in a hard cut; canonical content is now read from the bundled npm package (no `.agents/` materialization in user repos), and the manifest moved to `.hatch3r/hatch.json`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full breaking-change list and migration notes.

## Quick Start

Requires Node.js 22+.

```bash
npx hatch3r init --default  # recommended: zero-prompt setup with the standard profile
npx hatch3r init            # interactive: customize profile, tools, and CLI tools (6 prompts for GitHub greenfield; +1 for Azure DevOps, +1 for `custom` preset, +1 for workspace mode)
```

`--default` generates a working standard-profile setup with no questions — the fastest path to a configured repo. The interactive `init` detects your repo, infers your project context (greenfield/brownfield, solo/team), then walks platform → repo identity → content profile (minimal/standard/full/custom) → tools → CLI-tools picker, and generates everything. MCP is not prompted — opt in with `--mcp` or `npx hatch3r mcp setup` later. The platform (GitHub, Azure DevOps, or GitLab) is auto-detected from your git remote either way. Run into issues? See [Troubleshooting](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/troubleshooting).

**Migrating from Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, legacy `.cursorrules`, or a root `AGENTS.md`?** Carry your existing rules across with `npx hatch3r init --import <cursor|copilot|windsurf|cursorrules|agents|auto>` (`--import auto` imports every format in one pass) — they land under `.hatch3r/overrides/rules/` (`.md` + `.mdc`) with per-file conflict reporting. See [Migrating from another tool](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/getting-started/quick-start#migrating-from-another-tool).

## What You Get

| Category | Count | Highlights |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Agents** | 30 | Code reviewer, lint-fixer, dependency auditor, implementer (sub-agentic), fixer, researcher, architect, DevOps, handoff loader / preparer, 10 content-quality specialists (UI/UX/security/reliability/testability/scalability/performance/maintainability/enhancability/product-spec), and more |
| **Skills** | 54 | Bug fix, feature implementation, issue workflow, release, incident response, context health, cost tracking, handoff prepare / resume, recipes, API spec, CI pipeline, migration, customization, board lifecycle, ad-hoc orchestration scaffold, 5 standalone CLI-tool skills (ripgrep, jq, gh, fd, fzf) + a 24-tool `cli-toolbox`, and more |
| **Rules** | 73 | Code standards, testing, API design, observability, theming, i18n, security patterns, agent orchestration, fan-out discipline, model allocation, context budgets, right-sizing, deep context analysis, handoff readiness, mobile + backend stack rules, and more |
| **Commands** | 32 | Board management, planning (router `plan`, feature, bug, refactor, test), workflow, quick-change, bug-pipeline, rework, debug, healthcheck, security-audit, onboard, benchmark, handoff (prepare/resume/list/complete/prune), and more |
| **CLI tools** | 29 across 3 tiers | Tier-1 default (ripgrep, fd, jq, yq, gh, delta, bat, sd, ast-grep, zstd); tier-2 conditional (Playwright, duckdb, qsv, taplo, glab, az-devops, Docker, llm, fzf, lazygit, difftastic); tier-3 opt-in (RTK, Stagehand, aichat, mods, Comby, miller, csvkit, Podman) -- emitted as per-tool canonical skills + a decision-tree overview |
| **MCP Servers** | 10 (opt-in) | Playwright, Context7, Filesystem, GitHub, Brave Search, Sentry, Postgres, Linear, Azure DevOps, GitLab -- pure opt-in since 2.0.0: `init --mcp` or `npx hatch3r mcp setup` (interactive init does not prompt for MCP; `features.mcp` defaults to false) |
| **Platforms** | 3 | GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab -- auto-detected from git remote |

## Supported Tools (3 Adapters)

| Tool | Output |
|------|--------|
| **Cursor** | `.mdc` rules, agents, skills, commands, MCP config |
| **GitHub Copilot** | instructions, prompts, GitHub agents |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md`, skills, `.mcp.json` |

Platform is auto-detected from your git remote during `hatch3r init`. All board commands, agents, rules, and skills adapt to your selected platform.

## How It Works

```
.hatch3r/                              <- hatch3r footprint in your repo
  ├── hatch.json                       <- Manifest
  ├── overrides/                       <- User-authored canonical overrides (escape hatch)
  ├── learnings/                       <- /learn-captured project knowledge
  ├── handoffs/                        <- Cross-session handoff bundles
  └── mcp/mcp.json                     <- Resolved MCP server config

.claude/                               <- Generated (Claude Code adapter) + CLAUDE.md at repo root
.cursor/                               <- Generated (Cursor adapter)
.github/copilot-instructions.md        <- Generated (Copilot adapter, plus .github/instructions, .github/prompts, .github/agents)
.worktreeinclude                       <- Generated (worktree isolation)
```

Canonical content (agents, skills, rules, commands, hooks) lives inside the bundled npm package -- adapters read from there directly, so end-user repos no longer contain a `.agents/` mirror. The only hatch3r-managed directory in your repo is `.hatch3r/`. hatch3r can also manage multiple git repos from a single workspace root -- see the [Workspace guide](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/guides/workspace).

**Where canonical content lives:** to inspect the exact agent/rule/skill files a generated output was produced from, look inside the installed package at `node_modules/hatch3r/dist/content/` (the `agents/`, `skills/`, `rules/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `mcp/` subtree). A global install resolves under your npm global prefix (`npm root -g` → `hatch3r/dist/content/`). This bundled tree is read-only and is the single source of truth for canonical inputs.

## Workflow

hatch3r provides a full project lifecycle, from setup to release:

1. **Initialize** -- `npx hatch3r init` detects your repo and platform, asks about profile, tools, and CLI tools, generates agents/skills/rules/commands. For headless CI, pass `--yes` (add `--mcp` to also configure MCP servers).
2. **Set up the board** -- `hatch3r-board-init` creates or connects a Projects V2 board with status fields, label taxonomy, and config writeback.
3. **Define work** -- Create a `todo.md` at the project root (one item per line).
4. **Fill the board** -- `hatch3r-board-fill` parses `todo.md`, classifies items, groups into epics, builds a dependency DAG, and marks issues `status:ready`.
5. **Groom the backlog** -- `hatch3r-board-groom` surfaces stale items, priority imbalances, and decomposition candidates.
6. **Pick up work** -- `hatch3r-board-pickup` auto-selects the next issue by dependency order and priority, creates a branch, delegates implementation, and opens a PR.
7. **Review cycle** -- Reviewer + fixer agents loop (max 3 iterations) until clean, then testability and security specialists run final checks.
8. **Release** -- `hatch3r-release` determines the semver bump, generates a changelog, tags, and publishes.

> **After init:** For greenfield, run `hatch3r-project-spec` then `hatch3r-roadmap`. For brownfield, run `hatch3r-codebase-map`. For a single feature, run `hatch3r-feature-plan`. For small changes, run `hatch3r-quick-change`.

## Commands

### CLI Commands

```bash
npx hatch3r init          # Interactive setup (or --default for zero prompts)
npx hatch3r setup [dir]   # Scaffold a new project (mkdir + git init) then run init
npx hatch3r config        # Reconfigure tools, MCP servers, features, and platform
npx hatch3r sync          # Re-generate from canonical state
npx hatch3r update        # Pull latest templates (safe merge)
npx hatch3r status        # Check sync status between canonical and generated files
npx hatch3r validate      # Validate bundled canonical content + on-disk adapter outputs
npx hatch3r verify        # Drift check on adapter outputs (non-zero exit on drift)
npx hatch3r clean         # Remove generated files (optional --reinit)
npx hatch3r worktree-setup <path>   # Set up gitignored files in a worktree
npx hatch3r worktree-cleanup <path> # Clean up worktree-specific files
npx hatch3r cli-tools     # Manage CLI tools (picker / list / install / detect)
npx hatch3r mcp           # Manage MCP servers (setup / list / remove / env-check)
npx hatch3r add <pack>    # Install a content pack (local path or installed npm package)
```

`hatch3r cli-tools` and `hatch3r mcp` are side-door entry points for users who skipped a section during init. `cli-tools` defaults to the picker (`list`, `install`, `detect` are the other subcommands); `mcp` requires a subcommand (`setup`, `list`, `remove <id>`, `env-check`).

Every non-stub command accepts `--format <human|json>` and `--quiet`; mutating commands add `--dry-run`. `--format json` emits exactly one JSON document on stdout and is an exit-2 usage error on a prompting invocation.

### Agent Commands

Invoked inside your coding tool (e.g., as Cursor commands). All are prefixed `hatch3r-`.

- **Board management:** `board-fill`, `board-pickup` (lifecycle helpers `board-init`, `board-groom`, `board-refresh`, `board-shared` ship as skills)
- **Planning:** `plan` (router), `project-spec`, `codebase-map`, `roadmap`, `feature-plan`, `bug-plan`, `refactor-plan`, `migration-plan`, `test-plan`, `api-spec`
- **Workflow:** `workflow`, `quick-change`, `rework`, `debug`, `onboard`, `benchmark`, `hooks`, `learn`, `pr-resolve`, `handoff`
- **Operations:** `healthcheck`, `security-audit`, `report` (helpers `dep-audit`, `release`, `context-health`, `cost-tracking`, `recipe` ship as skills)
- **Customization:** `create` (single `hatch3r-customize` skill covers agent/command/skill/rule customization)

See the [CLI Commands reference](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/reference/commands/cli-commands) and [Agent Commands reference](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/reference/commands/agent-commands) for full details.

## CLI Tools

Since 1.7.5, hatch3r ships a first-class CLI-tools surface as the token-efficient alternative to MCP. The picker runs during `init` (3 tiers grouped, tier-1 default-on, tier-2 conditional on detected project signals, tier-3 opt-in). Detection probes each tool via `command -v` / `where` with a 2s timeout; the installer prints copy-paste commands grouped by package manager and never executes on your behalf. 5 essentials (ripgrep, jq, gh, fd, fzf) ship as standalone skills; the remaining 24 tools live in a single `hatch3r-cli-toolbox` skill, emitted to all 3 adapters. Manage at any time via `npx hatch3r cli-tools [list|install|detect]`. See [CLI Tools](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/getting-started/cli-tools) for the full 29-tool table and the trade-off discussion vs MCP.

## MCP Configuration

Since 1.7.5, MCP is **opt-in**; since 2.0.0 interactive `npx hatch3r init` no longer offers an MCP prompt. Without an opt-in, init skips MCP entirely -- no `.env.mcp`, no `mcp.json`, no servers in the manifest, and `features.mcp` stays false. When you opt in (`init --mcp` on any init path, or `npx hatch3r mcp setup` afterwards), hatch3r writes a gitignored `.env.mcp` with the required environment variables and MCP config to the tool-appropriate location (`.cursor/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`).

- **VS Code / Copilot:** secrets pass via the `env` object in `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- **Cursor / Claude Code / others:** source the file first: `set -a && source .env.mcp && set +a && cursor .`

Manage MCP at any time via `npx hatch3r mcp setup | list | remove <id> | env-check`. **CI note:** interactive init no longer offers MCP, and `npx hatch3r init --yes` does not configure it by default -- opt in via `npx hatch3r mcp setup` or `init --mcp`. See [MCP Setup](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/guides/mcp-setup) for per-server details and PAT scope guidance.

## Content Profiles

During `hatch3r init`, you choose a content profile:

| Profile | What's included | Best for |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | Core agents and workflows only (`core` tag) | Quick setup, minimal footprint |
| **Standard** (recommended) | Full lifecycle; drops AI feature engineering + performance capability clusters -- pick Full if you need those | Most projects |
| **Full** | Everything including board management and all audits | Large teams, full coverage |
| **Custom** | Choose exactly what you need | Fine-grained control |

After init, use `hatch3r config` to add or remove individual content items.

## Sub-Agentic Architecture

A four-phase pipeline (Research, Implement, Review Loop with reviewer + fixer at max 3 iterations, Final Quality with testing + security) drives implementation. The implementer agent receives a single sub-issue and returns code + tests; the fixer agent applies targeted fixes from reviewer findings; the issue-workflow skill runs an 8-step flow with parallel sub-agent delegation for epics. Tooling hierarchy: project docs > codebase search > library docs (Context7) > web research. See [Agent Teams](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/guides/agent-teams) for delegation patterns; hatch3r is complementary to rule-distribution tools like Ruler — it owns the full generation pipeline rather than distributing a single instruction file.

## Why hatch3r vs just AGENTS.md?

AGENTS.md (Linux Foundation AAIF spec, 60K+ repos as of January 2026) is the greatest-common-denominator markdown standard for agent instructions; it is consumed by 20+ tools including Cursor, Copilot, Codex, and Gemini CLI. hatch3r is complementary: AGENTS.md describes one file's content; hatch3r owns the entire generation pipeline that emits tool-native configurations across 5 artifact classes (rules, skills, commands, hooks, MCP servers) for 3 supported platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot). Three measurable differences:

- **Scope:** AGENTS.md is one flat instruction file per repo; hatch3r generates platform-specific structured output (`.mdc` rules with frontmatter scoping for Cursor, `CLAUDE.md` with managed blocks for Claude Code, `.github/instructions/` + `.github/prompts/` for Copilot) plus board commands, MCP server configs, and event-driven hooks.
- **Currency:** AGENTS.md content is hand-edited per project; hatch3r ships canonical content (30 agents + 73 rules + 54 skills + 32 commands + 7 hooks + 10 MCP servers — see [`governance/inventory.json`](governance/inventory.json)) audited each release across 24 governance domains.
- **Adoption path:** AGENTS.md remains the spec hatch3r-emitted Cursor / Claude / Copilot configurations align with — the 1.9.0 hard-cut withdrew direct AGENTS.md emission per CONSTITUTION §6 Decision #12, but AAIF spec evolution feeds per-adapter feature work for the 3 supported adapters. Use AGENTS.md alone when one flat file suffices for your project; use hatch3r when you need the full content + tooling stack.

## Customization

hatch3r separates managed from custom files:

- `hatch3r-*` files are managed and fully replaced on update; files without the prefix are your customizations and are never touched.
- All hatch3r-generated markdown uses managed blocks (`<!-- HATCH3R:BEGIN -->` / `<!-- HATCH3R:END -->`); content outside the markers is preserved.
- User-authored canonical overrides live under `.hatch3r/overrides/` (escape hatch); adapters prefer overrides over bundled content.
- Configure preferred AI models per agent via `hatch.json` (global default + per-agent overrides), agent frontmatter, or `.hatch3r/agents/{id}.customize.yaml`. Resolution order: customization file > manifest per-agent > agent frontmatter > manifest default. See [Model Selection](https://docs.hatch3r.com/docs/guides/model-selection).

## Editor Plugin

hatch3r ships plugin manifests for both Claude Code (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) and Cursor (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`). Install it straight from this repo as a marketplace — in Claude Code, run `/plugin marketplace add hatch3r/hatch3r` then `/plugin install hatch3r@hatch3r` — for access to all rules, skills, agents, and commands without running `init`.
