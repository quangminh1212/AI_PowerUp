> ⚠️ **Independent project** — Not affiliated with Anthropic PBC. The skills are plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter and work with any LLM coding agent that supports the same convention.

## Give any LLM coding agent the instincts of a senior engineer

A senior engineer knows when a `--no-verify` flag is hiding a real bug, when an empty `catch {}` is silently swallowing an auth check, what to do when a customer's WordPress site starts redirecting to a casino, and how to harden a fresh VPS in thirty minutes. **Your AI coding agent doesn't — unless you give it these skills.**

This repo contains **34 production-tested defensive security skills**, each a self-contained Markdown file with YAML frontmatter so Claude Code (or any compatible agent) can auto-trigger the right one. Every skill comes from real incident-response, hardening, and audit work — generalized so the patterns travel beyond the original engagement. Clone it, point your agent at it, and your next deploy, audit, or 3am alert gets expert-level guidance in seconds.

## What's inside — 13 security domains

| Domain | Skills | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 🤖 AI & LLM security | 5 | MCP security · agent guardrails · prompt injection defense · OWASP LLM Top 10 · coding-agent failure modes |
| 🌐 Web application | 6 | WordPress · Next.js · Payload CMS · API (OWASP API Top 10) · Stripe webhooks · file upload safety |
| 🏗️ Server & infrastructure | 5 | VPS · Cloudflare · Postgres · Docker · Kubernetes |
| 🛰 Distributed systems | 3 | Distributed-system audit · native-agent / client security · message bus (NATS / RabbitMQ / Kafka) |
| 🎯 Architecture & reliability | 2 | Backend architecture (twelve-factor, stateless deploys) · backups & disaster recovery |
| 🔎 Audit & review | 2 | Codebase audit methodology · site / server audit checklist |
| 🔐 Identity & access | 2 | Auth hardening (NIST 800-63B, MFA tiers) · secret hygiene & rotation |
| 📦 Supply chain & CI/CD | 2 | npm / pnpm / typosquat defense · GitHub Actions (OIDC, SHA pinning) |
| 📋 Compliance (EU / DACH) | 2 | GDPR technical controls · DACH Impressum / Datenschutz / AGB |
| 🔍 Detection & monitoring | 2 | Log strategy (operational / access / audit) · honeypots & tarpits |
| 🛡️ Incident response | 1 | SANS PICERL runbook with post-mortem template |
| 📨 Email security | 1 | SPF / DKIM / DMARC (with the p=none → p=reject migration path) |
| 📱 Mobile security | 1 | iOS / macOS — Keychain, ATS, certificate pinning, jailbreak signal |

## Who this is for


- **Developers shipping with LLM assistance ("vibe coders")** who need a security checklist that actually fits how they work — agent loops, MCP servers, fast iterations, small teams
- **Solo operators and small agencies** running 5–50 WordPress sites, a few VPS servers, and Cloudflare — without a dedicated security team
- **Engineers building LLM-powered features** (chat, RAG, agents, MCPs) who need a defensive baseline against prompt injection, exfiltration, and runaway costs
- **Anyone inheriting an undocumented production system** who wants a fast, structured way to audit it

Each skill is **defensive only**. No exploitation, no offensive tradecraft. Authorization for the systems you work on is assumed.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoldenWing-360/claude-security-skills.git
```

Use any skill in three ways:

1. **As a Claude Code skill** — Claude auto-triggers the right one based on the conversation. The YAML `description` field is matched against your request.
2. **As a runbook for yourself** — open `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and follow the steps.
3. **As a checklist for review** — paste the skill into a PR or audit doc and walk through it.

## Skill anatomy

Every `SKILL.md` follows a consistent structure that doubles as a discovery contract and a self-contained runbook:

```markdown
---
name: <kebab-case-slug>
description: <three-sentence summary — what / covers / invoke when>
---

# <Skill title>

<one-paragraph framing>

## When to invoke
- <concrete situation>

## <Body — adaptive per skill>
detection · steps · patterns · common gotchas

## Quick checklist
- [ ] ...

## What this skill will not do
- <explicit non-goals — defensive-only stance>
```

A companion [`index.json`](./index.json) at the repo root indexes every skill's slug, name, description, and domain for programmatic use (skill discovery, agent loading, search UIs).

## Documentation

Reference material that complements the skills:

- 📝 **[Prompt Library](./docs/PROMPTS.md)** — ready-to-use prompts that reliably trigger each of the 34 skills
- 📖 **[Security Glossary](./docs/GLOSSARY.md)** — definitions of terms used across the skills (BOLA, mTLS, RPO/RTO, slopsquatting, ...)
- ❓ **[FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md)** — installation, compatibility, contribution flow, commercial use

## Compatibility

Skills use plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). Tested target is **Claude Code**; the same files work with any LLM coding agent that supports the convention — including Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, Cline, Continue.dev, and Gemini CLI. Nothing in the body is platform-specific.

Every skill is a self-contained `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus a body that follows roughly: *when to invoke → detection / steps / patterns → checklist → what this skill will not do*.

## Using with Claude Code

Drop the directory in a path Claude Code scans for skills, or reference the skills directly. Claude matches the YAML `description` against your request and loads the matching `SKILL.md`. If you prefer to work without auto-triggering, just `cat` the relevant `SKILL.md` and follow it manually.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome, especially:

- Additional detection patterns observed in the wild (with IOCs anonymized)
- Updated rotation procedures as providers change their APIs
- Translations (the original is English; the maintainer also operates in German)
- New skills for under-covered areas

Please keep contributions defensive in spirit. No exploitation tradecraft, no recommendations to weaken existing protections.

## Maintainers

Maintained by [GoldenWing](https://goldenwing.at). Patterns here are distilled from real cleanup, hardening, and incident-response work. Specific indicators of compromise and customer details have been generalized so the guidance is portable.
