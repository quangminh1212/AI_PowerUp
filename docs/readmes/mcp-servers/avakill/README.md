## The Problem

AI agents are shipping to production with **zero safety controls** on their tool calls. The results are predictable:

- **Replit's agent** dropped a production database and fabricated 4,000 fake user accounts to cover it up.
- **Google's Gemini CLI** wiped a user's entire D: drive — 8,000+ files, gone.
- **Amazon Q** terminated EC2 instances and deleted infrastructure during a debugging session.

These aren't edge cases. Research shows AI agents fail in **75% of real-world tasks**, and when they fail, they fail catastrophically — because nothing sits between the agent and its tools.

**AvaKill is that missing layer.** A firewall that intercepts every tool call, evaluates it against your safety policies, and kills dangerous operations before they execute. No ML models, no API calls, no latency — just fast, deterministic policy checks in <1ms.

## Quickstart

```bash
pipx install avakill
avakill setup
```

> **macOS note:** macOS 14+ blocks `pip install` at the system level (PEP 668). Use `pipx` or a virtualenv.

`avakill setup` walks you through an interactive flow that:

1. **Detects agents** across three enforcement paths (hooks, MCP proxy, OS sandbox)
2. **Creates a policy** from a catalog of 81 rules across 14 categories
3. **Installs hooks** for detected agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Codex, Kiro, Amp, OpenClaw)
4. **Wraps MCP servers** for MCP-capable agents (Claude Desktop, Cline, Continue)
5. **Shows sandbox commands** for agents that support OS-level containment
6. **Enables tracking** (optional) for audit logs and diagnostics

After setup, test it:

```bash
echo '{"tool": "Bash", "args": {"command": "rm -rf /"}}' | avakill evaluate --policy avakill.yaml
# deny: Matched rule 'block-catastrophic-shell'
```

Safe calls pass through. Destructive calls are killed before they execute.

### Optional framework extras

```bash
pip install "avakill[openai]"       # OpenAI function calling
pip install "avakill[anthropic]"    # Anthropic tool use
pip install "avakill[langchain]"    # LangChain / LangGraph
pip install "avakill[mcp]"          # MCP proxy
pip install "avakill[all]"          # Everything
```

## How It Works

AvaKill enforces a single YAML policy across three independent enforcement paths. Each path works standalone — no daemon required, no single point of failure.

```
avakill.yaml (one policy file)
    |
    ├── Hooks (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Codex, Kiro, Amp, OpenClaw)
    |     → work standalone, evaluate in-process
    |
    ├── MCP Proxy (wraps MCP servers)
    |     → works standalone, evaluate in-process
    |
    ├── OS Sandbox (launch + profiles)
    |     → works standalone, OS-level enforcement
    |
    └── Daemon (optional)
          → shared evaluation, audit logging
          → hooks/proxy CAN talk to it if running
          → enables: logs, fix, tracking, approvals, metrics
```

## Integrations

### Native Agent Hooks

Protect AI agents with zero code changes — just install the hook:

```bash
# Install hooks (works standalone — no daemon required)
avakill hook install --agent claude-code  # or cursor, windsurf, gemini-cli, openai-codex, kiro, amp, openclaw, all
avakill hook list
```

Hooks work standalone by default — each hook evaluates policies in-process. Policies use canonical tool names (`shell_execute`, `file_write`, `file_read`) so one policy works across all agents.

| Agent | Hook Status |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Battle-tested |
| Cursor | Supported |
| Windsurf | Supported |
| Gemini CLI | Supported |
| OpenAI Codex | Supported |
| Kiro | Supported |
| Amp | Supported |
| OpenClaw | Native plugin (6-layer) |

**OpenClaw native plugin:** OpenClaw uses a dedicated plugin ([avakill-openclaw](https://github.com/log-bell/avakill-openclaw)) with 6 enforcement layers — hard block, guard tool, output scanning, message gate, spawn control, and context injection. Install with `openclaw plugins install avakill-openclaw`. Sandbox is available as a fallback via `avakill launch --agent openclaw`.

### MCP Proxy

Wrap MCP servers to route all tool calls through AvaKill:

```bash
avakill mcp-wrap --agent claude-desktop   # or cursor, windsurf, cline, continue, all
avakill mcp-unwrap --agent all            # Restore original configs
```

Supported agents: Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Continue.dev.

### OS Sandbox

Launch agents in OS-level sandboxes with pre-built profiles:

```bash
avakill profile list                    # See available profiles
avakill profile show aider              # See what a profile restricts
avakill launch --agent aider -- aider   # Launch with OS sandbox
```

Profiles ship for OpenClaw (fallback — prefer the [native plugin](https://github.com/log-bell/avakill-openclaw)), Cline, Continue, SWE-Agent, and Aider.

### Python SDK

For programmatic integration, AvaKill's `Guard` is available as a Python API:

```python
from avakill import Guard, protect

guard = Guard(policy="avakill.yaml")

@protect(guard=guard, on_deny="return_none")  # or "raise" (default), "callback"
def execute_sql(query: str) -> str:
    return db.execute(query)
```

**Framework wrappers:**

```python
# OpenAI
from avakill import GuardedOpenAIClient
client = GuardedOpenAIClient(OpenAI(), policy="avakill.yaml")

# Anthropic
from avakill import GuardedAnthropicClient
client = GuardedAnthropicClient(Anthropic(), policy="avakill.yaml")

# LangChain / LangGraph
from avakill import AvaKillCallbackHandler
handler = AvaKillCallbackHandler(policy="avakill.yaml")
agent.invoke({"input": "..."}, config={"callbacks": [handler]})
```

## Policy Configuration

Policies are YAML files. Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom — first match wins.

```yaml
version: "1.0"
default_action: deny

policies:
  # Allow safe shell with allowlist + metacharacter protection
  - name: "allow-safe-shell"
    tools: ["shell_execute", "Bash", "run_shell_command", "run_command",
            "shell", "local_shell", "exec_command"]
    action: allow
    conditions:
      shell_safe: true
      command_allowlist: [echo, ls, cat, pwd, git, python, pip, npm, node, make]

  # Block destructive SQL
  - name: "block-destructive-sql"
    tools: ["execute_sql", "database_*"]
    action: deny
    conditions:
      args_match:
        query: ["DROP", "DELETE", "TRUNCATE", "ALTER"]
    message: "Destructive SQL blocked. Use a manual migration."

  # Block writes to system directories
  - name: "block-system-writes"
    tools: ["file_write", "file_edit", "Write", "Edit"]
    action: deny
    conditions:
      path_match:
        file_path: ["/etc/", "/usr/", "/bin/", "/sbin/"]

  # Scan for secrets in tool arguments
  - name: "block-secret-leaks"
    tools: ["*"]
    action: deny
    conditions:
      content_scan: true

  # Rate limit API calls
  - name: "rate-limit-search"
    tools: ["web_search"]
    action: allow
    rate_limit:
      max_calls: 10
      window: "60s"

  # Require human approval for file writes
  - name: "approve-writes"
    tools: ["file_write"]
    action: require_approval
```

**Policy features:**
- **Glob patterns** — `*`, `delete_*`, `*_execute` match tool names
- **Argument matching** — `args_match` / `args_not_match` inspect arguments (case-insensitive substring)
- **Shell safety** — `shell_safe` blocks metacharacters; `command_allowlist` restricts to known-good binaries
- **Path resolution** — `path_match` / `path_not_match` with symlink resolution, `~` and `$HOME` expansion
- **Content scanning** — `content_scan` detects secrets, PII, and prompt injection in arguments
- **Rate limiting** — sliding window (`10s`, `5m`, `1h`)
- **Approval gates** — `require_approval` pauses until a human grants or rejects
- **Enforcement levels** — `hard` (default), `soft`, or `advisory`
- **First-match-wins** — order matters, put specific rules before general ones

avakill setup                              # Interactive setup — detects agents, builds policy, installs hooks
avakill validate avakill.yaml              # Validate a policy file
avakill rules                              # Browse and toggle catalog rules
avakill rules list                         # Show all rules with sources
avakill rules create                       # Interactive custom rule creation
avakill reset                              # Factory-reset AvaKill
```

```

### Monitoring & Recovery

```bash
avakill fix                                # See why a call was blocked and how to fix it
avakill logs --denied-only --since 1h      # Query audit logs
avakill logs tail                          # Follow new events in real-time
avakill tracking on                        # Enable activity tracking
```

### Evaluate & Approve

```bash
echo '{"tool": "Bash", "args": {"command": "rm -rf /"}}' | avakill evaluate --policy avakill.yaml
avakill review avakill.proposed.yaml       # Review proposed policy changes
avakill approve avakill.proposed.yaml      # Activate proposed policy (human-only)
avakill approvals list                     # List pending approval requests
avakill approvals grant REQUEST_ID         # Approve a pending request
```

avakill keygen                             # Generate Ed25519 keypair
avakill sign avakill.yaml                  # Sign policy
avakill verify avakill.yaml                # Verify signature
avakill harden avakill.yaml                # Set OS-level immutable flags
avakill compliance report --framework soc2 # Compliance assessment
avakill compliance gaps                    # Show compliance gaps
```

### Generate Policies with Any LLM

```bash
avakill schema --format=prompt             # Generate a prompt for any LLM
avakill schema --format=prompt --tools="execute_sql,shell_exec" --use-case="data pipeline"
