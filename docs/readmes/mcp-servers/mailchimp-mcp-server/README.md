The most complete [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for the [Mailchimp Marketing API](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/): **227 tools** to query and manage your Mailchimp account from any MCP-compatible client. It covers the full campaign, audience, member, segment, automation and reporting surface, complete e-commerce (read and write), landing pages, File Manager, surveys, signup forms and verified domains, plus multi-account support and runtime-security guardrails (read-only, dry-run and audit modes, with per-tool risk metadata).

Uses the [Mailchimp Marketing API](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/) via [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). Not based on the official [mailchimp-marketing-python](https://github.com/mailchimp/mailchimp-marketing-python) client. I hit too many issues with it so I went with raw HTTP calls instead.

## Quick start

```bash
uvx mailchimp-mcp   # no install required; just needs MAILCHIMP_API_KEY
```

Add it to your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, …):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailchimp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mailchimp-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY": "your-key-us8",
        "MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Tip: start with `MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY=true` to explore safely, then flip it off when you are ready to write. See [Configuration](#configuration) for all options.

### Docker

A prebuilt image is published to the GitHub Container Registry on every release:

```bash
docker run --rm -i -e MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your-key-us8 ghcr.io/damientilman/mailchimp-mcp-server:latest
```

Or point your MCP client at it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailchimp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "-e", "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY", "-e", "MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY", "ghcr.io/damientilman/mailchimp-mcp-server:latest"],
      "env": {
        "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY": "your-key-us8",
        "MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation

### Using `uvx` (recommended)

No installation needed — run directly:

```bash
uvx mailchimp-mcp
```

### Using `pip`

```bash
pip install mailchimp-mcp
```

Then run:

```bash
mailchimp-mcp
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damientilman/mailchimp-mcp-server.git
cd mailchimp-mcp-server
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Mailchimp API key (format: `<key>-<dc>`, e.g. `abc123-us8`) |
| `MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY` | No | Set to `true` to disable all write operations (default: `false`) |
| `MAILCHIMP_DRY_RUN` | No | Set to `true` to preview write operations without executing them (default: `false`) |
| `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY_<NAME>` | No | API key for an additional named account (e.g. `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY_MARKETING`). Target it with the `account` argument. See [Multi-account](#multi-account). |
| `MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY_<NAME>` | No | Read-only mode for a specific named account (default: `false`) |
| `MAILCHIMP_DRY_RUN_<NAME>` | No | Dry-run mode for a specific named account (default: `false`) |
| `MAILCHIMP_AUDIT_LOG` | No | Set to `true` to emit a structured JSON audit event per tool dispatch to stderr (default: `false`). See [Runtime security](#runtime-security). |
| `MAILCHIMP_TOOLS` | No | Expose only a subset of tools to shrink the model's tool-list footprint (default: all). See [Tool profiles](#tool-profiles). |

The datacenter (`us8`, `us21`, etc.) is automatically extracted from each key.

### Safety modes

**Read-only mode** — When `MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY=true`, all write tools (create, update, delete, schedule, etc.) are blocked and return an error. Read tools work normally. This is the recommended default for shared or exploratory setups where you only need reporting and analytics.

**Dry-run mode** — When `MAILCHIMP_DRY_RUN=true`, write tools return a preview of the action they *would* perform (tool name, target resource, parameters, and its risk tier) without making any API call. Useful for testing prompts before going live.

### Runtime security

The server is designed for defense-in-depth alongside an external MCP gateway: it owns the *semantics* (which tools are reads, reversible writes, or irreversible) and exposes them as machine-readable signals a gateway can enforce on, rather than making the gateway guess which calls are dangerous.

**Risk metadata** — Every tool is classified as `read`, `write`, or `destructive` (irreversible data loss or an irreversible send). This surfaces two ways:

- **MCP tool annotations** — `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, and `idempotentHint` travel through the standard `tools/list`, so any compliant client or gateway reads them directly.
- **`describe_tools`** — a read tool returning `{name, risk, read_only, destructive, idempotent}` for every tool plus per-tier counts, for gateways that prefer a tool call.

**Structured audit log** — With `MAILCHIMP_AUDIT_LOG=true`, each dispatch emits one JSON event to stderr with the tool, its risk tier, the `destructive` flag, the target account, the outcome (`executed` / `blocked_read_only` / `dry_run`), and the inspected arguments. Bulky or sensitive values (e.g. base64 `file_data`) are redacted and response bodies are never logged, so the stream is a safe audit sink to tail centrally.

**Argument-contract validation** — All writes funnel through a single `_guard_write` chokepoint, and every request is validated before dispatch (pagination `count` capped to 1–1000, missing path IDs rejected), so malformed calls fail fast and consistently instead of hitting the API.

### Tool profiles

Exposing all 227 tools sends a large tool list to the model on every turn (~63k tokens). If you only need part of the surface, load a subset with one line:

```json
"env": { "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY": "your-key-us8", "MAILCHIMP_TOOLS": "read" }
```

`MAILCHIMP_TOOLS` accepts a comma-separated mix of **risk tiers** (`read`, `write`, `destructive`) and/or **exact tool names**; a tool is kept if either matches. Unset (or `all`) exposes everything.

- `read` — reporting and analytics only (~115 tools, ~29k tokens). A safe, lightweight default for exploration.
- `read,write` — everything except irreversible tools.
- `list_campaigns,get_campaign_report,send_campaign` — a hand-picked minimal set.

Tool descriptions are also trimmed of repeated boilerplate before they reach the model, so even the full set is leaner than the raw docstrings. Use `describe_tools` to see each tool's risk tier.

### Multi-account

By default the server uses the single `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY`, exposed as the `default` account. To manage several Mailchimp accounts from one server, add `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY_<NAME>` variables — the suffix becomes the lowercased account name (e.g. `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY_MARKETING` → `marketing`).

Every tool then accepts an optional `account` argument, e.g. `list_audiences(account="marketing")`. Selection is per call and stateless — there is no "current account" to switch, so a write always names its target. Omitting `account` uses `default`. Call `list_accounts` to see the configured names and their safety-flag state, and each account can carry its own `MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY_<NAME>` / `MAILCHIMP_DRY_RUN_<NAME>` flags (so a write-protected account and a writable one can live side by side). An unknown `account` returns an error listing the configured names.

Single-key setups are unaffected: with only `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` set, nothing changes.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailchimp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mailchimp-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY": "your-default-key-us8",
        "MAILCHIMP_API_KEY_MARKETING": "another-key-us5",
        "MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY_MARKETING": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP client configuration

Most MCP clients accept a JSON configuration block describing how to launch the server.
Configure yours to invoke `uvx mailchimp-mcp` (or `mailchimp-mcp` if installed via pip)
with `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` exported in the environment.

        "MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### CLI-based clients

If your MCP client provides a CLI to register servers, the equivalent invocation is:

```bash
mcp-cli add mailchimp \
  -e MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your-api-key-here \
  -- uvx mailchimp-mcp
```

Replace `mcp-cli` with your client's binary name. For read-only mode, add
`-e MAILCHIMP_READ_ONLY=true` to the command.

### Workflow recipes

Multi-step requests that chain tools end to end:

- **Weekly performance review** — *"Summarise my last week: list campaigns sent since Monday, pull each report, and rank them by click rate with one takeaway each."* Chains `search_campaigns` → `get_campaign_report` → `get_campaign_advice`.
- **Deliverability audit** — *"Check my sending health: are my domains verified, any spam complaints on recent campaigns, and how did the last one perform by recipient domain?"* Chains `list_verified_domains` → `get_campaign_abuse_reports` → `get_domain_performance`.
- **Re-engagement** — *"Find everyone who didn't open my last newsletter and resend it with a new subject line."* Chains `get_campaign_report` → `resend_to_non_openers`.
- **Safe send** — *"Dry-run a campaign to my VIP segment, show me the send checklist, then send it once I confirm."* With `MAILCHIMP_DRY_RUN=true`, previews via `create_campaign` → `get_campaign_send_checklist` → `send_campaign`.
- **Agencies (multi-account)** — *"For both the `acme` and `globex` accounts, list this month's top campaign by open rate."* Passes `account="acme"` / `account="globex"` per call. See [Multi-account](#multi-account).
