# ATLAS — AI Transport Logistics Agent Standard

**The open-source MCP server that gives AI agents deep context about your logistics operations — without your data ever leaving your infrastructure.**

## The Problem

Enterprise logistics companies have years of operational data — emails, contracts, TMS records, carrier relationships, pricing history. AI agents need this context to be useful. But sharing raw data with external cloud services is a non-starter for compliance, legal, and security teams.

The result: AI stays shallow. Agents can't negotiate from context. Every interaction starts from zero.

## The Solution

ATLAS runs **inside your security perimeter**. It connects to your existing systems, indexes your data locally, and exposes a standardized MCP interface. Any AI agent can query ATLAS — getting deep operational context — without your data ever leaving your infrastructure.

```
[Your Company]                        [Cargofy / Any AI Agent]
  ├── Email                                      │
  ├── TMS                    MCP Protocol        │
  ├── ERP          ←─────────────────────────────┤
  ├── Contracts              (questions only,    │
  ├── Knowledge Base          no raw data out)   │
  └── ATLAS instance ────────────────────────────┘
```

Your data stays with you. Agents get the context they need.

## Quick Start

**Option 1: Docker (recommended)**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 cargofy/atlas
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — the Setup Wizard will guide you through initial configuration.

For production use with persistent data and AI features, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

**Option 2: Claude Desktop**

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json` under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "atlas": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "cargofy/atlas", "node", "src/index.js"]
  }
}
```

**Option 3: Run from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cargofy/ATLAS
cd ATLAS
npm install
cp config.example.yml config.yml   # edit with your settings
node seed.js                       # optional: load sample data
node src/ui-server.js              # Web UI + API on port 3000
# or
node src/index.js                  # MCP server on stdio
```

---

| **Chat** | Conversational AI interface with tool calling for logistics queries |
| **Playground** | Test MCP tools directly from the browser |
| **Knowledge Base** | Manage enterprise knowledge files (markdown, folders, CRUD) |
| **Import** | Upload data files (JSON, CSV, XLSX), seed database, import from folders |
| **Connectors** | View and manage data source configurations, trigger manual sync |
| **Modules** | Enable/disable plugins, trigger sync, view module status |
| **Settings** | Visual + YAML config editor with live reload |
| **Setup Wizard** | First-run configuration (AI provider, security, instance name) |

---

## MCP Tools

ATLAS exposes **35 MCP tools** via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Any MCP-compatible agent can connect:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Discovery** | `get_available_models`, `get_schema`, `get_available_carriers`, `get_available_lanes`, `get_available_document_types`, `get_sync_status` |
| **Query** | `get_records`, `query` (natural language search across all data) |
| **Shipments** | `get_shipment`, `get_shipments`, `get_shipment_events`, `get_unsigned_documents`, `get_closure_checklist` |
| **Carriers** | `search_carriers`, `get_carrier_shipments` |
| **Rates** | `get_rate_history` |
| **Documents** | `list_documents` |
| **Operations** | `get_sla_violations`, `get_idle_assets`, `get_anomalies`, `get_active_issues` (20+ disruption types) |

---

## AI Features

ATLAS supports multiple AI providers with role-based model routing:

| Provider | Models | Use |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Sonnet/Opus/Haiku | Chat, extraction, knowledge enrichment |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini | Chat, extraction |
| **Ollama** | Any local model | Fully offline operation |

**AI capabilities:**
- **Entity extraction** — upload any logistics document (PDF, CSV, XLSX, email) and extract structured data (shipments, carriers, rates, documents)
- **Knowledge enrichment** — AI automatically updates your knowledge base from extracted data, detecting contradictions and appending new facts
- **Chat with tools** — conversational interface that queries your data using MCP tools
- **Role routing** — assign different models to different tasks (chat, extraction, knowledge)

---

- **Audit logs** — full log of every query made to your instance
- **Open source** — inspect every line of code

---

## Use Cases

**Carrier Negotiation Agent**
> Agent queries ATLAS: "What's our volume with DHL on DE→PL in Q4?" → Gets answer from your own data → Negotiates from a position of knowledge.

**Customer Service Agent**
> "Where is shipment #12345?" → Agent queries ATLAS for shipment status from your TMS → Answers instantly without manual lookup.

**Procurement Agent**
> "Who are the top 3 carriers for refrigerated transport to Ukraine?" → Agent pulls from your historical performance data in ATLAS → Makes data-driven recommendation.
