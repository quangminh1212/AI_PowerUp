> Econometrics MCP server for regression, causal inference, time series, panel data, machine learning, and broader statistical analysis workflows.

## Overview

`aigroup-econ-mcp` is a professional econometrics-oriented MCP server designed to help AI assistants and MCP clients perform structured quantitative analysis.

It covers:

- parameter estimation and regression analysis
- causal inference workflows
- microeconometrics and panel data
- time series and volatility models
- machine learning for econometric tasks
- spatial econometrics, decomposition, and inference tools

## Highlights

- **66 professional tools** across core econometrics domains
- **Multiple input formats** including CSV, JSON, TXT, and Excel
- **Multiple output formats** including JSON, Markdown, and text
- **Support for MCP clients** such as RooCode, Claude-compatible tools, and other MCP hosts
- **Broad method coverage** from OLS and IV to ARIMA, GARCH, GAM, and causal forests
- **Designed for research and applied analysis** rather than narrow single-task workflows

## Tool Groups

The server currently groups its 66 tools across the following categories:

- **Basic parametric estimation** — OLS, MLE, GMM
- **Causal inference** — DID, IV, PSM, fixed/random effects, RDD, synthetic control, event study, and more
- **Decomposition analysis** — Oaxaca-Blinder, ANOVA, time-series decomposition
- **Machine learning** — random forest, gradient boosting, SVM, neural networks, clustering, DML, causal forest
- **Microeconometrics** — logit, probit, multinomial logit, Poisson, negative binomial, Tobit, Heckman
- **Missing data handling** — simple imputation and MICE
- **Model diagnostics and robust inference** — specification tests, GLS, WLS, robust errors, regularization, simultaneous equations
- **Nonparametric methods** — kernel regression, quantile regression, spline regression, GAM
- **Spatial econometrics** — weights matrices, Moran's I, Geary's C, LISA, spatial regression, GWR
- **Statistical inference** — bootstrap and permutation tests
- **Time series and panel data** — ARIMA, exponential smoothing, GARCH, unit-root tests, VAR/SVAR, cointegration, dynamic panel, panel VAR, structural breaks, time-varying parameter models

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- `uvx` recommended for easiest usage, or `pip`

### Run with uvx

```bash
uvx aigroup-econ-mcp
```

If `uvx` keeps using an older cached build:

```bash
uvx --no-cache aigroup-econ-mcp
```

### Install with pip

```bash
pip install aigroup-econ-mcp
aigroup-econ-mcp
```

### macOS users: install libomp for XGBoost-backed tools

A subset of machine-learning tools links against `xgboost`, which requires the
OpenMP runtime (`libomp.dylib`) at import time. Without it, these four tools
return a `tool_unavailable` payload even though the server itself starts fine:

- `ml_kmeans_clustering`
- `ml_hierarchical_clustering`
- `ml_double_machine_learning`
- `ml_causal_forest`

Install once with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install libomp
```

Linux / Windows users are unaffected — the xgboost wheels bundle or locate
OpenMP automatically.

## MCP Client Configuration

### Claude-compatible MCP clients / RooCode / similar tools

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aigroup-econ-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["aigroup-econ-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Input & Output Support

### Supported input formats

- CSV
- JSON
- TXT
- Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)

Typical usage patterns:

- direct structured data input
- raw file content input
- local file path input

### Supported output formats

- `json` (default — structured Pydantic result serialized)
- `markdown` (human-readable tables and coefficient stars)
- `text` (compact `str(model.model_dump())` fallback)

## Example Use Cases

- OLS and generalized regression modeling
- difference-in-differences and instrumental variable analysis
- matching and regression discontinuity workflows
- random forest / gradient boosting / causal forest analysis
- ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, and cointegration modeling
- panel diagnostics and dynamic panel estimation

## Calling tools

Every tool accepts parameters either **inline** (direct lists) or **from a
file** via `file_path`. The server returns a JSON string; on failure the
payload has a uniform `{"ok": false, "error": {...}}` shape.

### Inline: OLS regression

```json
{
  "name": "basic_parametric_estimation_ols",
  "arguments": {
    "y_data": [1.0, 2.1, 2.9, 4.1, 5.0, 5.9, 7.1, 8.0, 8.9, 10.1],
    "x_data": [[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0], [5.0],
               [6.0], [7.0], [8.0], [9.0], [10.0]],
    "output_format": "json"
  }
}
```

### File-based: causal DID from a CSV

Your CSV first column is the dependent variable (`y_data`), the rest are
covariates (`x_data`). For domain-specific keys like `treatment`,
`time_period`, `outcome`, supply a `.json` file:

```json
// policy.json
{"treatment": [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1],
 "time_period": [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
 "outcome":    [4.1,4.8,3.9,5.6,4.0,4.7,3.8,5.5]}
```

```json
{
  "name": "causal_difference_in_differences",
  "arguments": {"file_path": "policy.json", "output_format": "markdown"}
}
```

### Time series: ARIMA with forecast

```json
{
  "name": "time_series_arima_model",
  "arguments": {
    "data": [/* monthly observations */],
    "order": [1, 1, 1],
    "forecast_steps": 6,
    "output_format": "markdown"
  }
}
```

### Interpreting `fit_warnings`

Several models return a `fit_warnings` array. A non-empty value means the
statistic was a fallback placeholder — treat the associated numbers with
care. For example, a Cox regression with singular Hessian:

```json
{
  "coefficients": [...],
  "std_errors": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
  "p_values":   [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
  "fit_warnings": [
    "Hessian inversion failed; std_errors are placeholder 1.0 — Z/p values below are not real"
  ]
}
```

Seeing `p=1.0` with no warning means "not significant"; the same with a
warning means "could not compute".

### Debug mode

Set `AIGROUP_ECON_MCP_DEBUG=1` before launching the server to include
Python tracebacks inside the structured error payload — useful when
developing new MCP clients.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for layer boundaries and how
to add a new tool.

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest           # full suite, ~12 s (271 tests)
uv run pytest -m "not slow"   # fast iteration, ~1.5 s (264 tests)
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

All 66 registered tools are covered by a four-tier test pyramid:
registration-shape → smoke → mathematical-correctness (known-DGP) →
real MCP stdio protocol. See [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](docs/VERIFICATION.md)
for the testing paradigm, ground-truth DGPs, tolerance rationale, and
the record of real bugs this approach has surfaced (9 to date). See
[`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) for quick-run commands and the
test-file layout.

## Troubleshooting

### uvx resolves an old version

`uvx` caches per-version, so if a published release is not picked up:

```bash
uvx --refresh aigroup-econ-mcp
# or
uv cache clean
```
