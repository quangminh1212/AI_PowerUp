# higress-group/himarket

HiMarket is an enterprise-level "AI Capability Marketplace and Developer Ecosystem Hub." It is not merely a simple aggregation of traditional APIs, but rather a comprehensive platform that packages, publishes, manages, and operates core AI assets such as enterprise Model APIs, MCP Servers, Agent APIs, etc., through standardized product formats.

## What is HiMarket?

HiMarket is an enterprise-grade AI open platform built on Higress AI Gateway, helping enterprises build private AI capability marketplace to uniformly manage and distribute AI resources such as LLM, MCP Server, Agent, and Agent Skill. The platform encapsulates distributed AI capabilities into standardized API products, supports multi-version management and gray-scale release, includes a built-in Skills Marketplace for developers to browse and install Agent Skills, provides HiChat AI conversation and HiCoding online programming for self-service developer experience, and features comprehensive enterprise-level operation capabilities including security control, observability analysis, metering and billing, making AI resource sharing and reuse efficient and convenient.

As enterprises scale their AI adoption, they face common challenges: fragmented model usage across teams, security risks from uncontrolled public model access, difficulty in measuring AI costs and SLA, and complex permission management. HiMarket addresses these by providing a unified AI entry point for the entire organization — connecting AI producers and consumers through a standardized marketplace.

## System Architecture

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecbb3d2e-138b-4192-992e-9cd4a20b3fc3" alt="HiMarket System Architecture" width="700px" />
  <br/>
  <b>System Architecture</b>
</div>

HiMarket system architecture consists of three layers:

1. **Infrastructure**: Composed of AI Gateway, API Gateway, Higress and Nacos. HiMarket abstracts and encapsulates underlying AI resources based on these components to form standard API products for external use.
2. **AI Open Platform Admin**: Management platform for administrators to create and customize portals, manage AI resources such as MCP Server, Model, Agent, and Agent Skill, including setting authentication policies and subscription approval workflows. The admin portal also provides observability dashboard to help administrators monitor AI resource usage and operational status in real-time.
3. **AI Open Platform Portal**: Developer-facing portal site, also known as AI Marketplace or AI Hub, providing one-stop self-service where developers can complete identity registration, credential application, product browsing and subscription, online debugging, and more. Developers can also interact with models and MCP Servers through HiChat, or perform online AI programming in secure sandboxes through HiCoding.

## Quick Start

<details open>
<summary><b>Option 1: Local Setup</b></summary>

<br/>

**Requirements:** JDK 17, Node.js 18+, Maven 3.6+, MySQL 8.0+

**Start Backend:**

Configure database connection (add to `~/.env` or export directly):
```bash
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=3306
export DB_NAME=himarket
export DB_USERNAME=root
export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Build and start with one command:
```bash
make run
# Or run the script directly: ./scripts/run.sh
# The script auto-loads ~/.env, compiles, stops old processes, starts in background, and waits until ready
# Backend API: http://localhost:8080
```

**Start Frontend:**
```bash
# Start admin portal
cd himarket-web/himarket-admin
npm install
npm run dev
# Admin portal: http://localhost:5174

# Start developer portal
cd himarket-web/himarket-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Developer portal: http://localhost:5173
```

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2: Docker Compose</b></summary>

<br/>

**Requirements:** Docker, Docker Compose

**Script Deployment:** Use the interactive `install.sh` script to deploy the full stack (HiMarket, Higress, Nacos, MySQL) with guided configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/higress-group/himarket.git
cd himarket/deploy/docker
./install.sh
```

**AI Deployment (Recommended):** If you're concerned about environment compatibility issues during deployment, we recommend using AI Coding tools such as Cursor, Qoder, or Claude Code, which can automatically detect and resolve environment problems. After cloning the project, simply enter in your AI tool:

> Read the deployment docs under deploy/docker and help me deploy HiMarket with Docker Compose

See the [Deployment Guide](https://higress.io/docs/himarket/himarket-deployment/) for details.

**Service URLs after deployment:**
- Admin Portal: http://localhost:5174
- Developer Portal: http://localhost:5173
