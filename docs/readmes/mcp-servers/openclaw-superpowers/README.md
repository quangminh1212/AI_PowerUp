A plug-and-play skill library for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — the open-source AI agent runtime. Gives your agent structured thinking, security guardrails, persistent memory, cron scheduling, self-recovery, and the ability to write its own new skills during conversation.

Built for developers who want their AI agent to run autonomously 24/7, not just respond to prompts in a chat window.

> Inspired by [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). Extended for agents that never sleep.

---

## Why this exists

Most AI agent frameworks give you a chatbot that forgets everything between sessions. OpenClaw is different — it runs persistently, handles multi-hour tasks, and has native cron scheduling. But out of the box, it doesn't know *how* to use those capabilities well.

**openclaw-superpowers bridges that gap.** Install 56 skills in one command, and your agent immediately knows how to:

- **Think before it acts** — brainstorming, planning, and systematic debugging skills prevent the "dive in and break things" failure mode
- **Protect itself** — 6 security skills detect prompt injection, block dangerous actions, audit installed code, and scan for leaked credentials
- **Run unattended** — 12 cron-scheduled skills handle memory cleanup, health checks, budget tracking, and community monitoring while you sleep
- **Recover from failures** — self-recovery, loop-breaking, and task handoff skills keep long-running work alive across crashes and restarts
- **Never forget** — DAG-based memory compaction, integrity checking, context scoring, and SQLite session persistence ensure the agent preserves critical information even in month-long conversations
- **Improve itself** — the agent can write new skills during normal conversation using `create-skill`, encoding your preferences as permanent behaviors

---

## The self-modifying agent

This is what makes openclaw-superpowers different from every other plugin library:

> *"Every time I do a code review, check for security issues first."*

Your agent invokes `create-skill`, writes a new `SKILL.md`, and that behavior is live — immediately, permanently, no restart needed. The agent encodes your preferences as durable skills. You describe what you want. It teaches itself.

The `community-skill-radar` skill takes this further: it scans Reddit every 3 days for pain points and feature requests from the OpenClaw community, scores them by signal strength, and writes a prioritized `PROPOSALS.md` — so the agent (or you) always knows what to build next.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArchieIndian/openclaw-superpowers ~/.openclaw/extensions/superpowers
cd ~/.openclaw/extensions/superpowers && ./install.sh
openclaw gateway restart
```

`install.sh` symlinks all 56 skills, creates state directories for stateful skills, and registers cron jobs — everything in one step. That's it. Your agent now has superpowers.

## Important: install does not force behavior

Installing these skills does not guarantee that OpenClaw will follow `using-superpowers` or any other skill on every turn.

Why:

- `SOUL.md` and `AGENTS.md` are prompt inputs, not hard enforcement.
- Skills are exposed as available capabilities, and the model decides whether to read and apply them.
- Changes to installed skills are safest to validate in a fresh OpenClaw session.

For best results:

1. Start a new OpenClaw session after installation.
2. Verify the skill is eligible:

   ```bash
   openclaw skills list --eligible
   openclaw skills info using-superpowers
   ```

3. Put mandatory operating rules in `AGENTS.md`, not only `SOUL.md`.
4. Keep `AGENTS.md` and `SOUL.md` concise so they are less likely to be truncated.

If you need deterministic behavior:

- Move critical workflow rules into `AGENTS.md`.
- Use OpenClaw hooks or plugins to enforce behavior at runtime.
- Do not rely on `SOUL.md` alone to force deterministic skill execution.

```

**State model:** Each stateful skill commits a `STATE_SCHEMA.yaml` defining the shape of its runtime data. At install time, `install.sh` creates `~/.openclaw/skill-state/<skill-name>/state.yaml` on your machine. The schema is portable and versioned; the runtime state is local-only and never committed.

---

## Companion scripts

Skills marked with a script ship a small executable alongside their `SKILL.md`:

- **25 Python scripts** (`run.py`, `audit.py`, `check.py`, `guard.py`, `bridge.py`, `onboard.py`, `sync.py`, `doctor.py`, `loadout.py`, `governor.py`, `detect.py`, `test.py`, `radar.py`, `graph.py`, `optimize.py`, `compact.py`, `intercept.py`, `score.py`, `integrity.py`, `persist.py`, `recall.py`, `advise.py`, `gate.py`) — run directly to manipulate state, generate reports, or trigger actions. No extra dependencies; `pyyaml` is optional but recommended.
- **`vet.sh`** — Pure bash scanner; runs on any system with grep.
- Every script supports `--help` and `--format json`. Dry-run mode available on scripts that make changes.
- See the `example-state.yaml` in each skill directory for sample state and a commented walkthrough of cron behaviour.

## Use cases

**Solo developer with a persistent AI agent**
> Install superpowers, and your agent handles memory cleanup, security audits, and daily briefings on autopilot. You focus on building; the agent maintains itself.

**Team running multiple OpenClaw agents**
> Use `multi-agent-coordinator` for fleet health checks, `skill-loadout-manager` to keep system prompts lean per agent role, and `heartbeat-governor` to prevent runaway cron costs.

**Open-source maintainer**
> `community-skill-radar` scans Reddit for pain points automatically. `skill-vetting` catches malicious community contributions before they're installed. `installed-skill-auditor` detects post-install tampering.

**Security-conscious deployment**
> Six defense-in-depth skills: pre-install vetting, runtime injection detection, destructive action gates, post-install drift detection, credential scanning, and silent failure diagnosis.

2. Run `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`
3. Submit a PR — CI validates automatically
4. Community skills may be promoted to core over time
