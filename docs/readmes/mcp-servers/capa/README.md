CAPA is the package manager for AI coding agents. Declare your skills, tools, rules, sub-agents, MCP servers, and plugins once in `capabilities.yaml`, run `capa install`, and CAPA writes them into Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and 35+ other agents.

## Why CAPA?

AI coding agents need rules, tools, and conventions — and right now those live scattered across CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules/, AGENTS.md, MCP configs, and a half-finished internal doc. No two setups match.

CAPA collapses it into one `capabilities.yaml` next to your code: skills, tools, rules, sub-agents, plugins. capa install fans it out to every provider in its native format — .cursor/rules/ for Cursor, .claude/agents/ and CLAUDE.md for Claude Code, AGENTS.md for Codex, and so on. Capa-managed marker blocks keep your hand-written content untouched.

One file, version controlled, pinned by capabilities.lock, cached by SHA. The teammate who clones tomorrow gets the exact bytes you got today.

## What it does

- One `capabilities.yaml` manages the content for your agent. Write rules, hooks, and tools once — capa runs them natively, supporting 35+ agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and more). No more keeping `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/settings.json`, and `AGENTS.md` in sync by hand.
- 19–40% cheaper inference, same quality. One MCP server per agent, tools lazy-load on demand instead of front-loading the whole catalog. Measured across 150 trials on claude-opus-4-8.
- Sub-agents only see the tools they need. Each gets its own filtered MCP endpoint — so your research sub-agent isn't holding a git push tool it shouldn't touch.

## Installation

**macOS and Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://capa.infragate.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://capa.infragate.ai/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Quick start

### 1. Initialize your project

```bash
cd your-project
capa init
```

This creates a `capabilities.yaml` next to your code.

### 2. Install

```bash
capa install
```

### 3. Boostrap (Optional)
If you are already working on a project, and would like to get all of it's capabilities be managed by CAPA, simply use the `/bootstrap` skill. The agent will scan your project for skills, MCPs, relevant tools, hooks, and rules.

`capa install` resolves SHAs and downloads anything that isn't already in the cache. It then writes the per-provider files (`.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/agents/`, `AGENTS.md`, and so on) and registers one MCP endpoint with each agent on your list. The resolved SHAs land in `capabilities.lock` so the next clone gets the same bytes.

### 4. Use `capa sh`

```bash
capa sh                                  # list every configured tool
capa sh brave                            # list brave subcommands
capa sh brave search --query "…"         # run a tool directly
```

Every tool you define is also a CLI command under `capa sh`. MCP tools live at `capa sh <server> <tool>`. Shell tools live at the top level (or under whatever `group` you assigned).
