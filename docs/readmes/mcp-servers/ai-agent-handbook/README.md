# AI Agent Engineering Handbook

**How modern AI agents are built — from 30+ open-source framework codebases.**

Should you use LangGraph or CrewAI? What makes OpenClaw tick? Why does Claude Code compact at 92%?
How do you stop context rot from killing your agent at 25% fill?

This guide answers these questions — and 200 more.

## What is this

An organized collection of patterns, architectures, and implementation details from 30+ AI agent frameworks — extracted by reading their actual source code, system prompts, and compaction logic.

Not opinions. Not tutorials. Just documented patterns from codebases that are running in production.

## Why it exists

Most agent knowledge in 2026 is either surface-level blog posts or buried in source code nobody has time to read. We went through the codebases of OpenClaw, Claude Code, LangGraph, CrewAI, Hermes Agent, and 25+ others to document how they actually work — the agent loops, the prompt assembly, the context management, the memory systems, the tool architectures.

---

## Questions this answers

- LangGraph vs CrewAI vs PydanticAI — which one for what?
- How does OpenClaw's SOUL.md / AGENTS.md pattern work and why does everyone copy it?
- Why do agents get worse the longer they run? (context rot, and 12 ways to fight it)
- MCP servers are eating 72% of my context window — how do I fix tool sprawl?
- Should I use one agent or multiple? When does multi-agent actually help?
- How does Claude Code handle compaction? What survives, what gets dropped?
- What's the actual agent loop code? Is it really just a while loop?
- Skills as markdown vs. compiled tools — what do the top frameworks use?
- How does Hermes Agent improve itself over time? (episodic memory + self-evolution)
- What's the minimum viable agent architecture for production?

| I–II | **Agent Loops** | 8 loop variants with code: ReAct, Plan+Execute, Reflection, Compaction, Code-as-Action, Event-Driven, Graph State Machine, Heartbeat. Termination. Error recovery. |
| III | **System Prompts** | Assembly patterns. SOUL.md / AGENTS.md separation. Skill catalogs. Anti-patterns. |
| IV | **Context Management** | 6 compaction strategies with real prompts from Claude Code and OpenClaw. Trigger strategies. What survives compaction. |
| IV-B | **Context Rot** | 3 mechanisms. 12 defenses. The 40-60% rule. Agent Cognitive Compressor. Measuring degradation. |
| V | **Memory** | 5-tier hierarchy. File-based vs. vector vs. observational vs. episodic. 8 framework implementations compared. |
| VI | **Tools** | MCP. Code-as-action. Skills-as-markdown. JIT loading. Tool sprawl (72% context consumed). 7 solutions. Progressive disclosure. SDP. |

## Selected findings

Things we found that weren't obvious:

- **A 100-line agent scores 74% on SWE-bench.** The loop is the easy part. Context assembly, tool design, and memory are what matter.
- **Context quality degrades starting at ~25% window fill**, not at 100%. Every frontier model tested shows this (Chroma Research, 18 models).
- **Three MCP servers consumed 143K of 200K tokens** with tool descriptions alone — before the agent read a single user message. Tool selection accuracy drops from 43% to 14% with bloated toolsets.
- **Personality and operational instructions should be separate files.** OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Hermes converged on this independently.
- **The primary reason to use sub-agents is context isolation**, not parallelism. Anthropic measured 90.2% improvement.
- **Skills defined as markdown files** (not code) is the dominant extensibility pattern across Claude Code, OpenClaw, and Cline. Progressive 3-tier loading cuts token cost by 94%.
- **Re-injecting instructions near the end of context** defeats "instruction centrifugation" — system prompt influence fading as context grows.
