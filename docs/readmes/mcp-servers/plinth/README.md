## Goal

An opinionated AI-native workflow for evolving modern Java Enterprise `SDLC` practices through reusable `Skills`, `Agents`, `Commands` & `MCP servers`.

## What is a Plinth?

> A `plinth` represents the solid foundation or platform used to support statues or artworks in art and sculpture. It served as a structural and symbolic foundation for columns, statues, and entire temple podiums. Romans inherited the idea from Greek architecture but expanded its use to emphasize monumentality, hierarchy, and imperial power.

## Project at a glance

- 11 Commands
- 9 Agents
- 119 Skills
- ~226 development hours

## Latest Updates

Explore the latest published content on https://jabrena.github.io/plinth/ and follow its evolution through new skills, improvements, and fixes in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Start in 60 seconds

Install every skill for your preferred agent:

```bash
# Cursor
npx skills add jabrena/plinth --skill '*' --agent cursor -y

# Claude Code
npx skills add jabrena/plinth --skill '*' --agent claude-code -y

# Codex
npx skills add jabrena/plinth --skill '*' --agent codex -y

# GitHub Copilot
npx skills add jabrena/plinth --skill '*' --agent github-copilot -y
```

### See it in action

Ask your agent:

```text
Use @110-java-maven-best-practices to review this Maven project located in examples/@maven/maven-demo
Explain the findings, apply the approved improvements, and validate the build.
```

![](documentation/images/herdr-example.png)

The skill guides the agent through a structured Maven review while keeping you in control of proposed changes.

## 5-Minute Onboarding

Learn to use this project following the quick guide [Getting Started in 5 minutes](./documentation/guides/GETTING-STARTED-IN-5-MINUTES.md).

### Migrating from legacy rules

Current `System prompts/rules` are deprecated and will be removed in `v0.18.0`. If you still use them, review the [release 0.14.0 article](https://jabrena.github.io/plinth/blog/2026/04/release-0.14.0.html).

## Choose your path

Commands compose the workflow by routing work to the right agent and skill set:

### Analysis & Design

Turn an idea into an actionable change with user stories, GitHub Issues or Jira, ADRs, diagrams, AI plan mode, and OpenSpec.

### Compliance (Alpha)

Review Java systems, AI models, and how GenAI tools are used across applications and delivery pipelines for regulation-aware engineering controls, evidence, and qualified owner handoffs spanning AI, data, security, product, platform, market, and governance. **<u>These skills support engineering awareness and do not provide legal advice.</u>**

## Project Components

The project generates a set of deliverables at the end of any iteration.

| Inventory     | Installation                                                                                    | Getting Started                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. [Commands](./documentation/guides/INVENTORY-COMMANDS-JAVA.md) | `@004-commands-installation` Install Commands in project | [`Commands`](./documentation/guides/COMMANDS.md) |
| 2. [Agents](./documentation/guides/INVENTORY-AGENTS-JAVA.md) | `@005-agents-installation` Install Agents in Cursor/Claude | [`Agents`](./documentation/guides/GETTING-STARTED-AGENTS.md)     |
| 3. [Skills](./documentation/guides/INVENTORY-SKILLS-JAVA.md) | `npx skills add jabrena/plinth --skill '*' --agent cursor -y` | [`Skills`](./documentation/guides/GETTING-STARTED-SKILLS.md)     |

### Compatibility

This project is compatible with any tool that supports `Commands`, `Agents`, `Skills`, `MCP Servers` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Skill Validations

Every push runs the following validation checks in [CI Builds](./.github/workflows/maven.yaml) to keep documentation and generated skills correct, consistent, and secure:

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 1. [MarkdownValidator](./markdown-validator/src/main/java/info/jab/mv/MarkdownValidator.java) | Protects the documentation layer by catching Markdown parsing drift and remote link failures before skill-specific checks run. |
| 2. [skill-check](https://github.com/thedaviddias/skill-check) | Confirms every generated skill follows the expected packaging contract, complementing scanners that focus on behavior or security risk. |
| 3. [cisco-ai-skill-scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner) by Cisco | Adds behavior-oriented security coverage by looking for risky skill flows that structural validation cannot see. |
| 4. [SkillSpector](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector) by NVIDIA | Provides an independent static quality and security review, useful for comparing findings against the other scanners. |
| 5. [Snyk Agent Scan](https://github.com/snyk/agent-scan) by SNYK | Focuses on agent-skill supply-chain and prompt-risk signals, adding another security perspective alongside Cisco and SkillSpector. |

## Limitations

### Lack of determinism

From the outset, be aware that results from interactions with these `Skills` and agents are not deterministic because of how the models behave, but you can mitigate that with clear goals and validation checkpoints.

### Not all models behave in the same way

Some interactive skills require `Premium` models for interactive use; otherwise they follow a fixed sequence of steps.

### Limits of interactions with models

Models can generate code, but they cannot execute it against your local data. To bridge that gap, some Skills include scripts you run locally.

### Software engineers must remain in the loop

This project supports software engineering work; it does not replace engineering judgment. A software engineer must review, guide, and validate AI-generated decisions, code, and outcomes before they are used.

### Access to corporate data

Use caution when a problem involves corporate databases or other sensitive organizational data. Before granting an AI-assisted workflow access, assess authorization, privacy, data leakage, retention, and unintended modification risks. Apply least-privilege access, human review, validation, and monitoring. See [OWASP GenAI Data Security Risks & Mitigations 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-genai-data-security-risks-mitigations-2026/), and the new set of [skills about EU regulation](#compliance-alpha).
