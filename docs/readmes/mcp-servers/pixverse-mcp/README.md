## FAQ

**How do I get a PixVerse API key?**
- Register at the PixVerse Platform and generate it under "API-KEY" in your account.

**What should I do if the server doesn't respond?**
1. Check whether your API key is valid
2. Ensure the configuration file path is correct
3. View error logs (typically in the log folders of Claude or Cursor)

**Does MCP support image-to-video or keyframe features?**
- Not yet. These features are only available via the PixVerse API. [API Docs](https://docs.platform.pixverse.ai)

**How to obtain credits?**
- If you haven't topped up on the API platform yet, please do so first. [PixVerse Platform](https://platform.pixverse.ai/billing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=mcp)

**What video formats and sizes are supported?**
- PixVerse supports resolutions from 360p to 1080p, and aspect ratios from 9:16 (portrait) to 16:9 (landscape).
- We recommend starting with 540p and 5-second videos to test the output quality.

**Where can I find the generated video?**
- You will receive a URL link to view, download, or share the video.

**How long does video generation take?**
- Typically 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on complexity, server load, and network conditions.

**What to do if you encounter a spawn uvx ENOENT error?**
- This error is typically caused by incorrect UV/UVX installation paths. You can resolve it as follows:

For Mac/Linux:
```
sudo cp ./uvx /usr/local/bin
```

For Windows:
1. Identify the installation path of UV/UVX by running the following command in the terminal:
```
where uvx
