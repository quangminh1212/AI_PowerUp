## Overview

The Heurist Agent Framework is built on a modular architecture that allows an AI agent to:

- Process text and voice messages
- Generate images and videos
- Interact across multiple platforms with consistent behavior
- Fetch and store information in a knowledge base (Postgres and SQLite supported)
- Access external APIs, tools, and a wide range of [Mesh Agents](./mesh/README.md) to compose complex workflows

## Heurist Mesh

![mesh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77a2ab3b-e35c-4313-8a5b-a0e751cac879)

**[Heurist Mesh](https://mesh.heurist.ai)** is the skills marketplace for AI agents - your gateway to Web3 intelligence. General-purpose AI models lack specialized knowledge about Web3 and often fail to deliver accurate results. Heurist Mesh solves this by providing 30+ specialized AI agents that are experts in crypto analytics, ready to give your applications or AI agents the Web3 expertise they need.

### Why Heurist Mesh?

- **Curated Web3 Tools**: We curate the best Web3 data sources and APIs, constantly monitored and updated for reliable performance.
- **Optimized for Agents**: Input/output formats optimized for AI agents - 70% fewer tool calls, 30-50% less token usage vs simple API wrappers.
- **Composable Architecture**: Mix and match specialized agents to build powerful workflows.
- **Flexible Access**: REST API with API key, [x402-enabled](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402) pay-per-use with USDC on Base, and MCP access.
- **Trusted Agent Standard**: Every agent MCP is registered on the [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) trusted agent standard on Ethereum.

### Agent Categories

| Category | Description | Example Agents |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Aggregated Crypto Insights** | Comprehensive token and market intelligence (recommended) | Token Resolver, Trending Tokens, Twitter Intelligence |
| **Token Information** | Price data, market metrics, token analytics | CoinGecko, DexScreener, Bitquery, aixbt |
| **Social Media** | Twitter/X analysis, influencer tracking, sentiment | Elfa, Moni, Twitter Info |
| **Blockchain Data** | On-chain analytics, address intelligence, forensics | Etherscan, ChainBase, Space and Time |
| **Web Search** | Web research with AI summarization | Exa, Firecrawl, Caesar |
| **Crypto Products** | Platform-specific tools for DeFi and NFTs | Pump.fun, LetsBonk, Zora, Aave |
| **Wallet Analysis** | Portfolio tracking and wallet behavior analysis | Pond AI, GoPlus, Zerion |

### Get Started with Mesh

- **Mesh Portal**: [mesh.heurist.ai](https://mesh.heurist.ai) - Browse agents and deploy dedicated MCP servers
- **REST API**: [API Documentation](https://docs.heurist.ai/dev-guide/heurist-mesh/)
- **X402 API**: [mesh.heurist.xyz/x402/agents](https://mesh.heurist.xyz/x402/agents) - Pay-per-use with USDC on Base
- **Full Agent List**: [View all agents](./mesh/README.md#appendix-all-available-mesh-agents)

### MCP Support

All Heurist Mesh agents are accessible via MCP. This means you can access them from any AI clients and frameworks that support MCP, including Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, LangChain, Google ADK, n8n, etc.

Visit [Heurist Mesh Console](https://mesh.heurist.ai/console) to view all MCP endpoints, and create private dedicated MCP servers by mixing and matching the agents that you need. The MCP server source code is available at [Github: heurist-mesh-mcp-server](https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-mesh-mcp-server).

### Usage and Development Guide

## Heurist Agent Framework Architecture

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/heurist-network/heurist-agent-framework) 🔍 Click the badge to explore technical insights, ask questions.

The framework follows a modular, component-based architecture:

<div align="center">
<img src="./docs/img/agent_hl.png" alt="Heurist Agent Framework" width="75%">
</div>

### Agent Structure

1. **BaseAgent** (Abstract Base Class)

   - Defines the interface and common functionality
   - Manages component initialization and lifecycle
   - Implements core messaging patterns

2. **CoreAgent** (Concrete Implementation)
   - Implements BaseAgent functionality
   - Orchestrates components and workflows
   - Handles decision-making for workflow selection

### Agent Interfaces

Each interface inherits from BaseAgent and implements platform-specific handling:

- **Telegram** (`interfaces/telegram_agent.py`)
- **Discord** (`interfaces/discord_agent.py`)
- **API** (`interfaces/flask_agent.py`)
- **Twitter** (`interfaces/twitter_agent.py`)
- **Farcaster** (`interfaces/farcaster_agent.py`)

### Heurist Core

Heurist Core provides a set of core components, tools, and workflows for building LLM-powered agents or agentic applications. It can be used as a standalone package or as part of the Heurist Agent Framework.

[Read the Heurist Core documentation](./core/README.md)

#### Components

The framework uses a modular component system:

- **PersonalityProvider**: Manages agent personality and system prompts
- **KnowledgeProvider**: Handles knowledge retrieval from vector database
- **ConversationManager**: Manages conversation history and context
- **ValidationManager**: Validates inputs and outputs
- **MediaHandler**: Processes images, audio, and other media
- **LLMProvider**: Interfaces with language models
- **MessageStore**: Stores and retrieves messages with vector search

#### Workflows

Workflows provide higher-level reasoning patterns:

- **AugmentedLLMCall**: Standard RAG + tools pattern for context-aware responses
- **ChainOfThoughtReasoning**: Multi-step reasoning with planning and execution phases
- **ResearchWorkflow**: Deep web search and analysis with hierarchical exploration

#### Tool Management

- **ToolBox**: Base framework for tool definition and registration
- **Tools**: Tool management and execution layer
- **ToolsMCP**: Integration with MCP Protocol for tool execution

#### External Clients

- **SearchClient**: Unified client for web search (Firecrawl/Exa)
- **MCPClient**: Client for MCP Protocol for local or remote servers.
