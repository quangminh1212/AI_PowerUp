### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angrysky56/NeoCoder-neo4j-ai-workflow.git
cd NeoCoder-neo4j-ai-workflow
```

#### 2. Set up Python and the virtual environment

Make sure you have [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed.

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.12  # if not already installed
pyenv local 3.11.12
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[dev,docs,gpu]'
```
#### 4. Start Neo4j and Qdrant

- **Neo4j:**
  Start your Neo4j server (locally or remote).
  Default connection: `bolt://localhost:7687`

Neo4j connection parameters:
- **URL**: `bolt://localhost:7687` (default)
- **Username**: `neo4j` (default)
- **Password**: Your Neo4j database password
- **Database**: `neo4j` (default)

  Set credentials via environment variables if needed:
  - `NEO4J_URL`
  - `NEO4J_USERNAME`
  - `NEO4J_PASSWORD`
  - `NEO4J_DATABASE`

- **Qdrant:**
  For persistent Qdrant storage, use this Docker command (recommended):

  ```bash
  docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v "$(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z" \
    qdrant/qdrant
  ```

  This will store Qdrant data in a `qdrant_storage` folder in your project directory.

#### 5. (Optional) VS Code users

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), select **Python: Select Interpreter**, and choose `.venv/bin/python`.


1. It should auto-install when using the config- not sure anymore haven't tried that and some dependencies are rather large.

#### Potential Quickstart- lol sorry

## Recommended: Claude Desktop Integration:

   Configure Claude Desktop by adding the following to your
`claude-app-config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neocoder": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/your-path-to/NeoCoder-neo4j-ai-workflow",
        "run",
        "mcp_neocoder"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URL": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "your-neo4j-password-here",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "neo4j",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO",
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

   **Important**: The password in this configuration must match your
Neo4j database password.

Otherwise- Install dependencies:
**Quick Troubleshooting:**

- If you see errors about missing packages, double-check that your `.venv` is activated and you are using the correct Python version.
- If you need to reset your environment, you can remove `.venv` and repeat the steps above.
- Can't conect to DB? Install neo4j Desktop and QDRANT. Make sure they are running. NEO4J requires a password set.

```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant

docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v "$(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z" \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

Instructions for WolframAlpha use
- WolframAlpha understands natural language queries about entities in chemistry, physics, geography, history, art, astronomy, and more.
- WolframAlpha performs mathematical calculations, date and unit conversions, formula solving, etc.
- Convert inputs to simplified keyword queries whenever possible (e.g. convert "how many people live in France" to "France population").
- Send queries in English only; translate non-English queries before sending, then respond in the original language.
- Display image URLs with Markdown syntax: ![URL]
- ALWAYS use this exponent notation: `6*10^14`, NEVER `6e14`.
- ALWAYS use {"input": query} structure for queries to Wolfram endpoints; `query` must ONLY be a single-line string.
- ALWAYS use proper Markdown formatting for all math, scientific, and chemical formulas, symbols, etc.:  '$$\n[expression]\n$$' for standalone cases and '\( [expression] \)' when inline.
- Never mention your knowledge cutoff date; Wolfram may return more recent data.
- Use ONLY single-letter variable names, with or without integer subscript (e.g., n, n1, n_1).
- Use named physical constants (e.g., 'speed of light') without numerical substitution.
- Include a space between compound units (e.g., "Ω m" for "ohm*meter").
- To solve for a variable in an equation with units, consider solving a corresponding equation without units; exclude counting units (e.g., books), include genuine units (e.g., kg).
- If data for multiple properties is needed, make separate calls for each property.
- If a WolframAlpha result is not relevant to the query:
 -- If Wolfram provides multiple 'Assumptions' for a query, choose the more relevant one(s) without explaining the initial result. If you are unsure, ask the user to choose.
 -- Re-send the exact same 'input' with NO modifications, and add the 'assumption' parameter, formatted as a list, with the relevant values.
 -- ONLY simplify or rephrase the initial query if a more relevant 'Assumption' or other input suggestions are not provided.
 -- Do not explain each step unless user input is needed. Proceed directly to making a better API call based on the available assumptions.
```

## Multiple Incarnations

NeoCoder supports multiple "incarnations" - different operational modes that adapt the system for specialized use cases while preserving the core Neo4j graph structure. In a graph-native stack, the same Neo4j core can manifest as very different "brains" simply by swapping templates and execution policies.

### Key Architectural Principles

The NeoCoder split is highly adaptable because:
- Neo4j stores facts as first-class graph objects
- Workflows live in template nodes
- Execution engines simply walk the graph

Because these three tiers are orthogonal, you can freeze one layer while morphing the others—turning a code-debugger today into a lab notebook or a learning management system tomorrow. This design echoes Neo4j's own "from graph to knowledge-graph" maturation path where schema, semantics, and operations are deliberately decoupled.

### Common Graph Schema Motifs

All incarnations share these core elements:

| Element | Always present | Typical labels / rels |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Actor** | human / agent / tool | `(:Agent)-[:PLAYS_ROLE]->(:Role)` |
| **Intent** | hypothesis, decision, lesson, scenario | `(:Intent {type})` |
| **Evidence** | doc, metric, observation | `(:Evidence)-[:SUPPORTS]->(:Intent)` |
| **Outcome** | pass/fail, payoff, grade, state vector | `(:Outcome)-[:RESULT_OF]->(:Intent)` |

### Available Incarnations:

- **base_incarnation** (default) - Original NeoCoder, Tool, Templates and Incarnations Workflow management

### Implementation Roadmap

NeoCoder features an implementation roadmap that includes:

1. **LevelEnv ↔ Neo4j Adapter**: Maps events to graph structures and handles batch operations
2. **Amplitude Register (Quantum Layer)**: Optional quantum-inspired layer for superposition states
3. **Scheduler**: Prioritizes tasks based on entropy and impact scores
4. **Re-using TAG assets**: Leverages existing abstractions for vertical information hiding

### Starting with a Specific Incarnation

```bash
# List all available incarnations
python -m mcp_neocoder.server --list-incarnations

# Start with a specific incarnation
python -m mcp_neocoder.server --incarnation continuous_learning
```

Incarnations can also be switched at runtime using the `switch_incarnation()` tool:

```
switch_incarnation(incarnation_type="complex_system")
```

### Dynamic Incarnation Loading

NeoCoder features a fully dynamic incarnation loading system, which automatically discovers and loads incarnations from the `incarnations` directory. This means:

1. **No hardcoded imports**: New incarnations can be added without modifying server.py
2. **Auto-discovery**: Just add a new file with the format `*_incarnation.py` to the incarnations directory
3. **All tools available**: Tools from all incarnations are registered and available, even if that incarnation isn't active
4. **Easy extension**: Create new incarnations with the provided template

#### Creating a New Incarnation

To create a new incarnation:

1. Create a new file in the `src/mcp_neocoder/incarnations/` directory with the naming pattern `your_incarnation_name_incarnation.py`
2. Use this template structure:

```python
"""
Your incarnation name and description
"""

import json
import logging
import uuid
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional, Union

import mcp.types as types
from pydantic import Field
from neo4j import AsyncTransaction

from .polymorphic_adapter import BaseIncarnation, IncarnationType

logger = logging.getLogger("mcp_neocoder.incarnations.your_incarnation_name")


class YourIncarnationNameIncarnation(BaseIncarnation):
    """
    Your detailed incarnation description here
    """

    # Define the incarnation type - must match an entry in IncarnationType enum
    incarnation_type = IncarnationType.YOUR_INCARNATION_TYPE

    # Metadata for display in the UI
    description = "Your incarnation short description"
    version = "0.1.0"

    # Initialize schema and add tools here
    async def initialize_schema(self):
        """Initialize the schema for your incarnation."""
        # Implementation...

    # Add more tool methods below
    async def your_tool_name(self, param1: str, param2: Optional[int] = None) -> List[types.TextContent]:
        """Tool description."""
        # Implementation...
```

3. Add your incarnation type to the `IncarnationType` enum in `polymorphic_adapter.py`
4. Restart the server, and your new incarnation will be automatically discovered

See [incarnations.md](./docs/incarnations.md) for detailed documentation on using and creating incarnations.

## Customizing Templates

Templates are stored in the `templates` directory as `.cypher` files. You can edit existing templates or create new ones.

To add a new template:

1. Create a new file in the `templates` directory (e.g., `custom_template.cypher`)
2. Follow the format of existing templates
3. Initialize the database to load the template into Neo4j

## The 'Cypher Snippet Toolkit' tools operate on the graph structure defined below

Below is a consolidated, **Neo4j 5-series–ready** toolkit you can paste straight into Neo4j Browser, Cypher shell, or any driver.
It creates a *mini-documentation graph* where every **`(:CypherSnippet)`** node stores a piece of Cypher syntax, an example, and metadata; text and (optionally) vector indexes make the snippets instantly searchable from plain keywords *or* embeddings.

## 1 · Schema & safety constraints

```cypher
// 1-A Uniqueness for internal IDs
CREATE CONSTRAINT cypher_snippet_id IF NOT EXISTS
FOR   (c:CypherSnippet)
REQUIRE c.id IS UNIQUE;            // Neo4j 5 syntax

// 1-B Optional tag helper (one Tag node per word/phrase)
CREATE CONSTRAINT tag_name_unique IF NOT EXISTS
FOR   (t:Tag)
REQUIRE t.name IS UNIQUE;
```

## 2 · Indexes that power search

```cypher
// 2-A Quick label/property look-ups
CREATE LOOKUP INDEX snippetLabelLookup IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (n) ON EACH labels(n);

// 2-B Plain-text index (fast prefix / CONTAINS / = queries)
CREATE TEXT INDEX snippet_text_syntax IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:CypherSnippet) ON (c.syntax);

CREATE TEXT INDEX snippet_text_description IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:CypherSnippet) ON (c.description);

// 2-C Full-text scoring index (tokenised, ranked search)
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX snippet_fulltext IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:CypherSnippet) ON EACH [c.syntax, c.example];

// 2-D (OPTIONAL) Vector index for embeddings ≥Neo4j 5.15
CREATE VECTOR INDEX snippet_vec IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (c:CypherSnippet) ON (c.embedding)
OPTIONS {indexConfig: {
  `vector.dimensions`: 384,
  `vector.similarity_function`: 'cosine'
}};
```

*If your build is ≤5.14, call `db.index.vector.createNodeIndex` instead.*

## 3 · Template to store a snippet

```cypher
:params {
  snippet: {
    id:         'create-node-basic',
    name:       'CREATE node (basic)',
    syntax:     'CREATE (n:Label {prop: $value})',
    description:'Creates a single node with one label and properties.',
    example:    'CREATE (p:Person {name:$name, age:$age})',
    since:      5.0,
    tags:       ['create','insert','node']
  }
}

// 3-A MERGE guarantees idempotence
MERGE (c:CypherSnippet {id:$snippet.id})
SET   c += $snippet
WITH  c, $snippet.tags AS tags
UNWIND tags AS tag
  MERGE (t:Tag {name:tag})
  MERGE (c)-[:TAGGED_AS]->(t);
```

Parameter maps keep code reusable and prevent query-plan recompilation.

## 4 · How to search

### 4-A Exact / prefix match via TEXT index

```cypher
MATCH (c:CypherSnippet)
WHERE c.name STARTS WITH $term      // fast TEXT index hit
RETURN c.name, c.syntax, c.example
ORDER BY c.name;
```

### 4-B Ranked full-text search

```cypher
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes(
  'snippet_fulltext',               // index name
  $q                                // raw search string
) YIELD node, score
RETURN node.name, node.syntax, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4-C Embedding similarity (vector search)

```cypher
WITH $queryEmbedding AS vec
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes(
  'snippet_vec', 5, vec            // top-5 cosine hits
) YIELD node, similarity
RETURN node.name, node.syntax, similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

## 5 · Updating or deleting snippets

```cypher
// 5-A Edit description
MATCH (c:CypherSnippet {id:$id})
SET   c.description = $newText,
      c.lastUpdated = date()
RETURN c;

// 5-B Remove a snippet cleanly
MATCH (c:CypherSnippet {id:$id})
DETACH DELETE c;
```

Both operations automatically maintain index consistency – no extra work required.

## 6 · Bulk export / import (APOC)

```cypher
CALL apoc.export.cypher.all(
  'cypher_snippets.cypher',
  {useOptimizations:true, format:'cypher-shell'}
);
```

This writes share-ready Cypher that can be replayed with `cypher-shell < cypher_snippets.cypher`.

### Quick-start recap

1. **Run Section 1 & 2** once per database to set up constraints and indexes.
2. Use **Section 3** (param-driven) to add new documentation entries.
3. Query with **Section 4**, and optionally add vector search if you store embeddings.
4. Backup or publish with **Section 6**.

With these building blocks you now have a *living*, searchable "Cypher cheat-sheet inside Cypher" that always stays local, versionable, and extensible. Enjoy friction-free recall as your query repertoire grows!

*Note: A full reference version of this documentation that preserves all original formatting is available in the `/docs/cypher_snippets_reference.md` file.*
