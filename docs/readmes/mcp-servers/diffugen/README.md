## 🚀 Introduction

DiffuGen is a powerful MCP-based image generation system that brings cutting-edge AI models directly into your development workflow. It seamlessly integrates both Flux models (Flux Schnell, Flux Dev) and Stable Diffusion variants (SDXL, SD3, SD1.5) into a unified interface, allowing you to leverage the unique strengths of each model family without switching tools. With comprehensive parameter control and multi-GPU support, DiffuGen scales from rapid concept sketches on modest hardware to production-quality visuals on high-performance systems.

Built on top of the highly optimized [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) implementation, DiffuGen offers exceptional performance even on modest hardware while maintaining high-quality output.

## 🧠 Understanding MCP and DiffuGen

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol that enables LLMs (Large Language Models) to access custom tools and services. In simple terms, an MCP client (like Cursor, Windsurf, Roo Code, or Cline) can make requests to MCP servers to access tools that they provide.

### DiffuGen as an MCP Server

DiffuGen functions as an MCP server that provides text-to-image generation capabilities. It implements the MCP protocol to allow compatible IDEs to send generation requests and receive generated images.

The server exposes two main tools:
1. `generate_stable_diffusion_image`: Generate with Stable Diffusion models
2. `generate_flux_image`: Generate with Flux models

### Technical Architecture

DiffuGen consists of several key components:

- **setup-diffugen.sh**: The complete install utility and model downloader and manager
- **diffugen.py**: The core Python script that implements the MCP server functionality and defines the generation tools
- **diffugen.sh**: A shell script launcher that sets up the environment and launches the Python server
- **diffugen.json**: Template configuration file for MCP integration with various IDEs (to be copied into IDE's MCP configuration)
- **stable-diffusion.cpp**: The optimized C++ implementation of Stable Diffusion used for actual image generation

The system works by:
1. Receiving prompt and parameter data from an MCP client
2. Processing the request through the Python server
3. Calling the stable-diffusion.cpp binary with appropriate parameters
4. Saving the generated image to a configured output directory
5. Returning the path and metadata of the generated image to the client

### About stable-diffusion.cpp

[stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) is a highly optimized C++ implementation of the Stable Diffusion algorithm. Compared to the Python reference implementation, it offers:

- Significantly faster inference speed (up to 3-4x faster)
- Lower memory usage (works on GPUs with as little as 4GB VRAM)
- Optimized CUDA kernels for NVIDIA GPUs
- Support for various sampling methods and model formats
- Support for model quantization for better performance
- No Python dependencies for the core generation process

This allows DiffuGen to provide high-quality image generation with exceptional performance, even on modest hardware setups.

```

Note: Model download may take a long time depending on your internet connection. The SDXL model is approximately 6GB, SD3 is about 13GB, SD1.5 is around 4GB, and Flux models are 8-13GB each.

5. Update file paths in configuration:

Set shell script as Executable

```
chmod +x diffugen.sh
```

**Configuration Approach**:
DiffuGen uses a single configuration file (`diffugen.json`) as the source of truth for all settings. The workflow is:

1. Edit `diffugen.json` in the DiffuGen root directory with your desired settings
2. Run option 5 in `setup_diffugen.sh` to automatically update paths in this file
3. Copy the content of `diffugen.json` to your IDE's MCP configuration file

The file contains all necessary settings:
- File paths (command, SD_CPP_PATH, models_dir, output_dir)
- Default model parameters (steps, cfg_scale, sampling_method)
- VRAM usage settings
- Metadata for IDE integration

### Setting up with Claude in Anthropic Console

Claude can use DiffuGen if you've set it up as an MCP server on your system. When asking Claude to generate images, be specific about using DiffuGen and provide the parameters you want to use.

## 🎮 Usage

To start the DiffuGen server manually:

```bash
cd /path/to/diffugen
./diffugen.sh
```

Or using Python directly:

```bash
cd /path/to/diffugen
python -m diffugen
```

You should see: `DiffuGen ready` when the server is successfully started.

### OpenAPI Server Usage

The OpenAPI server provides a REST API interface for direct HTTP access to DiffuGen's image generation capabilities. This is in addition to the MCP integration and can be useful for:
- Direct HTTP API access
- Integration with other tools that don't support MCP
- Custom applications that need programmatic access

For detailed setup instructions and advanced configuration options, see the [OpenAPI Integration Guide](OPENAPI_SETUP.md).

To start the OpenAPI server:
```bash
python diffugen_openapi.py
```

The server can be configured to use a different host or port if needed. By default, it runs on:
- Host: 0.0.0.0
- Port: 8080

The server will be available at http://0.0.0.0:8080 with interactive documentation at http://0.0.0.0:8080/docs.

Generated images are saved to the `/output` directory by default. If this directory is not accessible, the server will automatically create an `output` directory in the current working directory. Images are served through the `/images` endpoint.

#### OpenWebUI Integration

1. Open OpenWebUI Settings (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the "Tools" section
3. Click the "+" button to add a new tool server
4. Enter the following details:
   - URL: http://0.0.0.0:5199
   - API Key: (leave empty)
5. Click "Save"

Once added, DiffuGen will appear in the available tools list when clicking the tools icon in the chat interface. The following endpoints will be available:
- `generate_stable_image_generate_stable_post`: Generate with Stable Diffusion
- `generate_flux_image_endpoint_generate_flux_post`: Generate with Flux Models
- `list_models_models_get`: List Available Models

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://0.0.0.0:5199/generate/flux" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "A beautiful sunset", "model": "flux-schnell"}'
```

Example using Python requests:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://0.0.0.0:5199/generate/flux",
    json={
        "prompt": "A beautiful sunset",
        "model": "flux-schnell"
    }
)
result = response.json()
```

### Default Parameters by Model

Each model has specific default parameters optimized for best results:

| Model | Default Steps | Default CFG Scale | Best For |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| flux-schnell | 8 | 1.0 | Fast drafts, conceptual images |
| flux-dev | 20 | 1.0 | Better quality flux generations |
| sdxl | 20 | 7.0 | High-quality detailed images |
| sd3 | 20 | 7.0 | Latest generation with good quality |
| sd15 | 20 | 7.0 | Classic baseline model |

These default parameters can be customized by adding a `default_params` section to your IDE's MCP configuration file:

```json
"default_params": {
  "steps": {
    "flux-schnell": 12,  // Customize steps for better quality
    "sdxl": 30           // Increase steps for more detailed SDXL images
  },
  "cfg_scale": {
    "sd15": 9.0          // Higher cfg_scale for stronger prompt adherence
  }
}
```

You only need to specify the parameters you want to override - any unspecified values will use the built-in defaults.

> **Note**: For model-specific command line examples and recommendations, see [Model-Specific Parameter Recommendations](#model-specific-parameter-recommendations) section.

### Asking a LLM to Generate Images

Here are examples of how to ask an AI assistant to generate images with DiffuGen:

#### Basic Requests:

```
Generate an image of a cat playing with yarn
```

```
Create a picture of a futuristic cityscape with flying cars
```

#### With Model Specification:

```
Generate an image of a medieval castle using the sdxl model
```

```
Create a flux image of a sunset over mountains
```

#### With Advanced Parameters:

```
Generate an image of a cyberpunk street scene, model=flux-dev, width=768, height=512, steps=25, cfg_scale=1.0, seed=42
```

```
Create an illustration of a fantasy character with model=sd15, width=512, height=768, steps=30, cfg_scale=7.5, sampling_method=dpm++2m, negative_prompt=blurry, low quality, distorted
```

### Parameter Reference

DiffuGen can be used from the command line with the following basic syntax:

```bash
./diffugen.sh "Your prompt here" [options]
```

Example:
```bash
./diffugen.sh "A futuristic cityscape with flying cars"
```

This command generates an image using default parameters (flux-schnell model, 512x512 resolution, etc.) and saves it to the configured output directory.

Below are the parameters that can be used with DiffuGen (applicable to both MCP interface and command line):

| Parameter | Description | Default | Valid Values | Command Line Flag |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| model | The model to use for generation | flux-schnell/sd15 | flux-schnell, flux-dev, sdxl, sd3, sd15 | --model |
| width | Image width in pixels | 512 | 256-2048 | --width |
| height | Image height in pixels | 512 | 256-2048 | --height |
| steps | Number of diffusion steps | model-specific | 1-100 | --steps |
| cfg_scale | Classifier-free guidance scale | model-specific | 0.1-30.0 | --cfg-scale |
| seed | Random seed for reproducibility | -1 (random) | -1 or any integer | --seed |
| sampling_method | Diffusion sampling method | euler | euler, euler_a, heun, dpm2, dpm++2s_a, dpm++2m, dpm++2mv2, lcm | --sampling-method |
| negative_prompt | Elements to avoid in the image | "" (empty) | Any text string | --negative-prompt |
| output_dir | Directory to save images | Config-defined | Valid path | --output-dir |

These parameters can be specified when asking an AI assistant to generate images or when using the command line interface. Parameters are passed in different formats depending on the interface:

- **In MCP/AI Assistant**: `parameter=value` (e.g., `model=sdxl, width=768, height=512`)
- **In Command Line**: `--parameter value` (e.g., `--model sdxl --width 768 --height 512`)

The default values are chosen to provide good results out-of-the-box with minimal waiting time. For higher quality images, consider increasing steps or switching to models like sdxl.

### Model-Specific Parameter Recommendations

> **Note**: These recommendations build on the [Default Parameters by Model](#default-parameters-by-model) section and provide practical examples.

For best results when using specific models via command line:

#### Flux Models (flux-schnell, flux-dev)
```bash
# Flux-Schnell (fastest)
./diffugen.sh "Vibrant colorful abstract painting" \
  --model flux-schnell \
  --cfg-scale 1.0 \
  --sampling-method euler \
  --steps 8

# Flux-Dev (better quality)
./diffugen.sh "Detailed fantasy landscape with mountains and castles" \
  --model flux-dev \
  --cfg-scale 1.0 \
  --sampling-method euler \
  --steps 20
```

#### Standard SD Models (sdxl, sd3, sd15)
```bash
# SDXL (highest quality)
./diffugen.sh "Hyperrealistic portrait of a Celtic warrior" \
  --model sdxl \
  --cfg-scale 7.0 \
  --sampling-method dpm++2m \
  --steps 30

# SD15 (classic model)
./diffugen.sh "Photorealistic landscape at sunset" \
  --model sd15 \
  --cfg-scale 7.0 \
  --sampling-method euler_a \
  --steps 20
```

### Default Parameter Changes

The command-line interface of DiffuGen uses the following defaults if not otherwise specified in configuration:

- Default Model: If not specified, function-appropriate models are used (flux-schnell for Flux functions, sd15 for SD functions)
- Default Sampling Method: `euler` (best for Flux models)
- Default CFG Scale: `1.0` for Flux models, `7.0` for standard SD models
- Default Steps: `8` for flux-schnell, `20` for other models
- Default Dimensions: 512x512 pixels

When using the command line, you don't need to specify these parameters unless you want to override the defaults. If you frequently use specific parameters, consider adding them to your configuration file rather than specifying them on each command line.

### Command Line Usage Notes

- Generated images are saved to the configured output directory with filenames based on timestamp and parameters
- You can generate multiple images in sequence by running the command multiple times
- For batch processing, consider creating a shell script that calls DiffuGen with different parameters
- To see all available command-line options, run `./diffugen.sh --help`
- The same engine powers both the MCP interface and command-line tool, so quality and capabilities are identical

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configuration Approach

DiffuGen uses a single configuration approach centered around the `diffugen.json` file:

1. **Primary Configuration File**: `diffugen.json` in the DiffuGen root directory is the single source of truth for all settings
2. **IDE Integration**: Copy the contents of `diffugen.json` to your IDE's MCP configuration file
3. **Environment Variables**: For advanced usage, you can override settings with environment variables

### Environment Variable Overrides

For advanced usage, you can override settings using environment variables:

- `SD_CPP_PATH`: Override the path to stable-diffusion.cpp
- `DIFFUGEN_OUTPUT_DIR`: Override the output directory
- `DIFFUGEN_DEFAULT_MODEL`: Override the default model
- `DIFFUGEN_VRAM_USAGE`: Override VRAM usage settings
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: Control which GPUs are used for generation

### Setting IDE-Specific Configurations

DiffuGen allows you to have different configurations for different IDEs by using environment variables in each IDE's MCP configuration. This lets you maintain a single base `diffugen.json` while customizing parameters per IDE.

The configuration priority works as follows:
1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Settings from local `diffugen.json` file (base configuration)

**Example: Different Output Directories for Different IDEs**

For Cursor (in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
"env": {
  "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES": "0",
  "SD_CPP_PATH": "/path/to/stable-diffusion.cpp",
  "DIFFUGEN_OUTPUT_DIR": "/cursor/specific/output/directory",
  "default_model": "flux-schnell"
}
```

For Windsurf (in `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`):
```json
"env": {
  "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES": "0",
  "SD_CPP_PATH": "/path/to/stable-diffusion.cpp",
  "DIFFUGEN_OUTPUT_DIR": "/windsurf/specific/output/directory",
  "default_model": "sdxl"
}
```

**Example: Different Default Models and VRAM Settings**

```json
"env": {
  "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES": "0",
  "SD_CPP_PATH": "/path/to/stable-diffusion.cpp",
  "default_model": "flux-dev", 
  "DIFFUGEN_VRAM_USAGE": "maximum"
}
```

This approach lets you customize DiffuGen's behavior per IDE while still using the same underlying installation.

### Key Configuration Elements

#### Command and Arguments

- **command**: Full path to the `diffugen.sh` script (must be absolute path)
- **args**: Additional command-line arguments to pass to the script (usually left empty)

#### Environment Variables

- **CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES**: Controls which GPUs are used for generation
  - `"0"`: Use only the first GPU
  - `"1"`: Use only the second GPU
  - `"0,1"`: Use both first and second GPUs
  - `"-1"`: Disable CUDA and use CPU only

- **SD_CPP_PATH**: Path to the stable-diffusion.cpp installation directory
  - This is used to locate the stable-diffusion.cpp binary and models

- **default_model**: The default model to use when none is specified

#### Resource Configuration

- **models_dir**: Directory containing the model files
  - Should point to the `models` directory inside your stable-diffusion.cpp installation

- **output_dir**: Directory where generated images will be saved
  - Must be writable by the user running DiffuGen

- **vram_usage**: Controls VRAM usage strategy
  - `"adaptive"`: Automatically adjust memory usage based on available VRAM
  - `"minimal"`: Use minimal VRAM at the cost of speed
  - `"balanced"`: Balance memory usage and speed (default)
  - `"maximum"`: Use maximum available VRAM for best performance

### IDE-Specific Options

Each IDE has specific options you can customize in the `diffugen.json` file:

#### Cursor Options

```json
"cursorOptions": {
  "autoApprove": true,
  "category": "Image Generation",
  "icon": "🖼️",
  "displayName": "DiffuGen"
}
```

#### Windsurf Options

```json
"windsurfOptions": {
  "displayName": "DiffuGen",
  "icon": "🖼️",
  "category": "Creative Tools"
}
```

### Customizing Default Parameters

You can customize default parameters for each model in the `default_params` section:

```json
"default_params": {
  "steps": {
    "flux-schnell": 12,
    "sdxl": 30
  },
  "cfg_scale": {
    "sd15": 9.0
  },
  "sampling_method": {
    "flux-schnell": "euler",
    "sdxl": "dpm++2m"
  }
}
```

### Updating Configuration Files

When using the automatic setup script, a properly configured `diffugen.json` file is created with the correct paths for your system when you run option 5. To integrate DiffuGen with your IDE:

1. Run option 5 in `setup_diffugen.sh` to update paths in `diffugen.json`
2. Copy the entire contents of the generated `diffugen.json` file
3. Paste it into your IDE's MCP configuration file (e.g., `~/.cursor/mcp.json`)
4. Restart your IDE to apply changes

The key advantage of this approach is a single source of truth for configuration, making it easier to maintain and update your DiffuGen setup.

## 📃 Advanced Usage

The DiffuGen Python module can be imported and used programmatically in your own Python scripts:

```python
from diffugen import generate_image

# Generate an image programmatically
result = generate_image(
    prompt="A starry night over a quiet village",
    model="sdxl",
    width=1024,
    height=768,
    steps=30,
    cfg_scale=7.0,
    seed=42,
    sampling_method="dpm++2m",
    negative_prompt="blurry, low quality"
)

print(f"Image saved to: {result['file_path']}")
```

### Using the OpenAPI Server

You can also use the OpenAPI server programmatically in your applications:

```python
import requests

def generate_image_via_api(prompt, model="flux-schnell", width=512, height=512):
    response = requests.post(
        "http://0.0.0.0:5199/generate/flux",
        json={
            "prompt": prompt,
            "model": model,
            "width": width,
            "height": height
        }
    )
    return response.json()

# Example usage
result = generate_image_via_api(
    prompt="A magical forest at night",
    model="flux-schnell",
    width=768,
    height=512
)
print(f"Generated image: {result['file_path']}")
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Missing models or incorrect paths**
   - Ensure all model files are downloaded and placed in the correct directories
   - Check that paths in the configuration file are correctly set
   - Verify file permissions allow read access to model files

2. **CUDA/GPU issues**
   - Make sure your NVIDIA drivers are up-to-date
   - Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to target a specific GPU
   - If running out of VRAM, try using a smaller model or reducing dimensions

3. **Image quality issues**
   - Increase steps for better quality (at the cost of generation time)
   - Adjust CFG scale: higher for more prompt adherence, lower for creativity
   - Try different sampling methods (dpm++2m often provides good results)
   - Use more detailed prompts with specific style descriptions

4. **File permission errors**
   - Ensure the output directory is writable by the user running DiffuGen
   - Check that all scripts have execution permissions (`chmod +x diffugen.sh`)
