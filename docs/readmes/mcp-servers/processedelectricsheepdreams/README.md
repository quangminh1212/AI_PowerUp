The main subject is a stack of four bowls, each of a different color. From top to bottom, the bowls are yellow, orange, green, blue, and red. The colors are solid and vibrant, giving a retro feel to the image. A silver spoon rests inside the top yellow bowl, with the handle extending diagonally towards the top left.

The bowls are centered in the frame, taking up a significant portion of the image. They are positioned on a dark, wooden table. The table's wood grain is visible, adding texture and warmth to the scene. The composition is simple, with the bowls being the primary focus.

In the background, there is a hint of the surrounding environment. To the left, a dark wooden chair is partially visible. To the right, a folded napkin or piece of cloth is seen. The walls appear to be a neutral color, likely cream or light gray. The lighting seems to be soft and indirect, casting gentle shadows. There are some light reflections across the background suggesting a window or other light source.

The image has a vintage aesthetic, due to the Polaroid format with the characteristic white border. The date "21/01/26" is hand written at the bottom right corner of the border, reinforcing the sense of nostalgia. The overall mood is calm and inviting, with the bright colors of the bowls creating a cheerful atmosphere.medium film grain"</i><br><br><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Native%20Resolution-27%20Second%20Generation-blue?style=for-the-badge" alt="Stats"/></td>

A slender, light-furred cat, exhibiting subtle tabby patterns, is comfortably draped across his shoulders and neck. The cat's head is lowered, resting gently on the man's left shoulder, its gaze directed downwards. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating subtle shadows that enhance the contours of their faces and the textures of the man's beard and sweater. The background is a smooth, undifferentiated medium grey, providing a minimalist and timeless backdrop.

## Model Information

This application supports multiple models with easy switching:

### Speed-Optimized (Default) ⭐
**[Disty0/Z-Image-Turbo-SDNQ-uint4-svd-r32](https://huggingface.co/Disty0/Z-Image-Turbo-SDNQ-uint4-svd-r32)**
- 4-bit SDNQ quantization optimized for maximum speed
- Fastest generation times
- ~3GB download, ~4GB VRAM
- Excellent quality with minimal compromise

### Quality-Optimized
**[Abrahamm3r/Z-Image-SDNQ-uint4-svd-r32](https://huggingface.co/Abrahamm3r/Z-Image-SDNQ-uint4-svd-r32)**
- 4-bit SDNQ quantization optimized for maximum quality
- Superior output fidelity
- ~3GB download, ~4GB VRAM
- Created by [@Abrahamm3r](https://huggingface.co/Abrahamm3r) (Self/OP)

### Base Model
**[Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo)**
- Full precision model without quantization
- Original Z-Image architecture
- ~5GB download, ~6GB VRAM

> **Both Disty0 and Abrahamm3r models use SDNQ quantization**, making them efficient on GPUs with limited VRAM. Models are automatically downloaded on first run.

### Performance Notes

- First generation may be slower due to model initialization
- Generation speed depends on resolution and GPU capability
- Lower dimensions (1024x1024) generate faster than higher resolutions
- **Speed vs Quality**: Disty0 generates ~15-20% faster; Abrahamm3r produces slightly higher fidelity
- **LoRA Note**: Quantized models use int4 precision. Some standard fp16 LoRAs may not apply correctly or may degrade quality. This feature is experimental.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Height must be divisible by 16"**
- Adjust dimensions to multiples of 16 (e.g., 1024, 1280, 1536)

**CUDA out of memory**
- Use Disty0 or Abrahamm3r quantized models (lower VRAM)
- Reduce output resolution
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- The application uses CPU offload to minimize VRAM requirements

**Slow generation**
- Ensure CUDA is properly installed
- Use Disty0 for fastest generation
- Lower the number of inference steps
- Reduce image resolution
