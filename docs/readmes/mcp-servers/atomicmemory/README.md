**Inspectable, portable semantic memory for agents and applications.**

AtomicMemory is a memory layer you embed where your AI code already runs. Capture
context, ground generations in prior interactions, and carry knowledge across
sessions — from a direct SDK call, a CLI, an MCP server, a framework adapter, or
a host plugin. Local-first where supported, hosted where convenient, and
designed so the choice can change later without rewriting your application.

Most memory products ask you to trust a hosted black box with the layer that
decides what an AI believes about your users. AtomicMemory takes the opposite
position: the interface should be portable, the engine should be inspectable,
and the memory system should be able to revise itself when facts change.

This repository is the public source of truth for the AtomicMemory JavaScript /
TypeScript packages, framework adapters, host plugins, and public smoke tests.

## Headline Results

AtomicMemory v66 is leading performance/cost on BEAM-100K, BEAM-1M, and LoCoMo10 under
matched methodology against published competitors. On BEAM-10M it matches the
strongest published Mem0-new result while leaving Hindsight-scale temporal
retrieval as the known open frontier.

| Benchmark | AtomicMemory v66 | Position | Cost/Q | Sample |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| **BEAM-100K lenient** | **0.7375** | Parity with Hindsight at 0.75 | $1.26 | n=80 |
| **BEAM-1M lenient** | **0.6625** | Leading Performance/Cost; +0.022 vs Mem0 paper | $0.083 | n=80 |
| **BEAM-10M lenient** | **0.4875** | Parity with Mem0-new at 0.486 | $0.081 | n=80 |
| **LoCoMo10 GPT-4o-mini binary** | **0.8396** | Leading Performance/Cost; +0.171 vs Mem0 paper | $0.066 | n=1540 |

These results put AtomicMemory at or near the published ceiling in each
reported category while preserving the lower-cost operating profile that
matters for real applications. Reproducibility artifacts and harness details
will be published with the benchmark materials.

## Why AtomicMemory

- **Portable**: a single memory protocol consumed by direct SDK calls, CLIs,
  the MCP server, framework adapters, and host plugins. The same memory store
  serves a LangGraph agent, a Claude Code session, and a custom Vercel AI
  application without re-implementing capture or retrieval semantics.
- **SDK-agnostic**: every adapter is built on the same SDK. Adapters are
  conveniences, not gatekeepers. You can drop down to the SDK at any time and
  keep the same data, indexes, and retrieval behavior.
- **Inspectable**: Core is open source, self-hostable, and built around
  explicit mutation decisions rather than an opaque hosted opinion.
- **Correction-aware**: memory is not just append and recall. Real products
  need supersession, clarification, deletion, no-op decisions, lineage, and
  trust-sensitive revision when users change their mind.
- **Model-surface portable**: the SDK lets applications swap memory backends;
  Core separates embeddings, extraction, mutation, reranking, retrieval
  packaging, and evaluation so the memory engine is not frozen to one model
  vintage.
- **Local or hosted, your choice**: the core engine runs locally for
  privacy-sensitive workloads. The hosted profile is available where it makes
  sense and is marked clearly in the package matrix below. There is no
  capability cliff between the two.
- **No lock-in**: package APIs are stable and semver-disciplined. Migrating
  between direct SDK use, adapters, and host plugins is documented and does not
  require re-ingesting your data. You own your memory store.

## What This Repository Provides

- **Core** — Docker-deployable memory backend with durable context, semantic
  retrieval, memory mutation, and Postgres/pgvector storage.
- **SDK** — backend-agnostic TypeScript client surface with provider interfaces,
  storage helpers, local embeddings, and semantic search primitives.
- **CLI and MCP** — command-line and MCP surfaces for setup, diagnostics,
  capture, retrieval, and context packaging.
- **Framework adapters** — integration packages for Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI
  Agents SDK, LangChain, LangGraph, and Mastra.
- **Host plugins** — package and manifest surfaces for agent hosts such as
  Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, Codex, and Cursor.
- **Public validation** — package metadata checks, smoke contracts, and
  contributor-safe CI gates that keep install paths, docs, and package status in
  sync.

The SDK is the portability contract: applications depend on a typed interface
and provider boundary instead of one memory vendor. Core is the engine that can
earn that slot: self-hosted, auditable, and designed around revision rather than
append-only recall.

## What This Is Not

- Not the hosted AtomicMemory service infrastructure.
- Not the release orchestration or marketplace operations system.
- Not the Python SDK; the Python package remains in its own repository and PyPI
  metadata for now.
- Not the benchmark research repo. Reproducible benchmark suites and raw eval
  harnesses live outside this public monorepo until they are ready to publish as
  public artifacts.
- Not a replacement for package-level READMEs. Package-specific setup still
  lives under `packages/`, `adapters/`, and `plugins/`.

## Performance posture

We make supportable performance claims, not marketing ones. The headline
results above are benchmark scores under matched methodology; latency,
recall@k, and scale-envelope claims should only be quoted when paired with the
linked benchmark, hardware, dataset, and date used to produce them.

Until latency benchmarks are linked from the docs, treat the engine as
"designed for single-digit-ms local retrieval on a developer laptop at typical
agent corpus sizes" — a design target, not a guarantee.

## Validation boundary

This section documents what this repository's public CI proves on its own, so
readers can see exactly what is verified here and do not assume this repository
independently proves every product claim. For what this repository is not
responsible for, see "What This Is Not" above.

**Proven in this repository's public CI (every pull request):**

- repo hygiene
- package metadata checks
- affected build, typecheck, lint, and self-contained package tests (Node 22
  and 24)
- code-health gates
- package `pack` dry-run plus tarball-shape verification
- docs contract (install commands, package status labels, and smoke rows stay
  in sync)
- public integration smoke
- security compliance

**Also in this repository, run in package or release contexts (not the per-PR
affected lane):**

- Core OpenAPI generation and drift check (`generate:openapi` / `check:openapi`)
- Core API schema tests (Schemathesis)
- Core Docker image smoke (runs in the Docker image publish workflow)
- DB-backed Core tests, which require Postgres/pgvector provisioning

## Quickstart

For the full walkthrough, see the
[AtomicMemory quickstart](https://docs.atomicstrata.ai/quickstart).

These commands use currently-published packages. Host plugin surfaces that are
not yet public are listed in the package matrix below and are not part of the
main install path.

```bash
# direct SDK
npm install @atomicmemory/sdk

# CLI
npm install -g @atomicmemory/cli

# framework adapter (example: Vercel AI SDK)
npm install @atomicmemory/vercel-ai @atomicmemory/sdk
```

Minimal SDK shape:

```ts
import { MemoryClient } from '@atomicmemory/sdk';

const memory = new MemoryClient({
  providers: {
    atomicmemory: { apiUrl: 'http://localhost:17350' },
  },
});

await memory.initialize();
await memory.ingest({
  mode: 'messages',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'I prefer aisle seats.' }],
  scope: { user: 'demo-user' },
});

const results = await memory.search({
  query: 'seat preference',
  scope: { user: 'demo-user' },
});
```

The minimal example, environment setup, and the full list of supported hosts
and frameworks live in the docs site linked below. Adapter and plugin install
contracts (install type, local-core requirement, hosted-mode status) appear at
the top of each integration page.

## Package matrix

Status labels follow the docs contract:

- **published** — available on the npm registry and supported.
- **implemented, publish pending** — code lives in this repo and works locally,
  but the first monorepo-era release has not been cut yet. Do not put these in
  install commands until the row flips to `published`.
- **coming soon** — public source is present, but the host install path is not
  supported yet. Do not use these in install commands until the row flips to
  `published`.
- **unsupported** / **planned** — reserved for future entries.

## Local development

The skeleton uses pnpm workspaces with Turborepo as the task graph and cache
layer. pnpm owns dependency resolution, workspace linking, and packing. Turbo
owns task ordering, caching, and affected-task selection.

```bash
# install (uses the pinned pnpm@9.15.4 from packageManager)
pnpm install

# build / typecheck / test
pnpm run build
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test       # self-contained packages
pnpm run test:core  # requires core test services
pnpm run lint

# release / hygiene gates (not cached; always re-run)
pnpm run pack-dry-run
pnpm run package-metadata
pnpm run docs-contract
pnpm run public-integration-smoke
pnpm run repo-hygiene
pnpm run security-compliance
```

Package versions are intentionally scoped by release family instead of one
global monorepo version. `@atomicmemory/core` and `@atomicmemory/sdk` move
independently. Host plugins move together, framework adapters move together,
and the CLI/MCP-server tool pair moves together:

```bash
pnpm check:version-families        # CI guard for drift
```

Release bumping, public sync, and registry publish preparation are owned by the
ops repo. Keep this source repo focused on package metadata and version-family
consistency checks.

Build, test, lint, and docs-contract run through Turborepo's task graph.
Typecheck declares no cache outputs because package scripts use `tsc --noEmit`.
The side-effecting checks (`pack-dry-run`, `public-integration-smoke`,
`repo-hygiene`, `code-health`, and `security-compliance`) always re-run through
`cache: false` tasks or direct root node scripts. `package-metadata` is a
direct root check so it always reads the current package manifests.

CI lanes use thin aliases over the same Turbo tasks:

```bash
pnpm run ci:affected         # build / typecheck / lint for affected packages; tests for self-contained packages
pnpm run ci:code-health      # fallow/code-health coverage
pnpm run ci:pack-dry-run     # pack-dry-run, affected-only
pnpm run ci:docs-contract    # docs-contract
pnpm run ci:public-smoke     # public-integration-smoke
```

`ci:affected` and `ci:pack-dry-run` use Turbo's `--affected` filter for normal
PRs; full release-green validation runs the unprefixed scripts so the required
surface is never narrowed by affected detection. The core package's DB-backed
test suite requires service provisioning and is intentionally outside the
generic affected lane; build, typecheck, lint, metadata, and pack validation
still cover `@atomicmemory/core` in public CI.

Per-package commands (`pnpm --filter @atomicmemory/sdk run build`, etc.) work
for packages in `packages/`, `adapters/`, and `plugins/`.

## Companion: llmwiki

[llmwiki](https://github.com/atomicstrata/llmwiki) is a separate knowledge compiler that turns raw sources into an interlinked markdown wiki. It is **valuable on its own** — useful as a notebook, RAG index, CI-checked knowledge base, or domain pack source — and remains so whether or not AtomicMemory is in the picture.

`@atomicmemory/llmwiki` (in this monorepo at `packages/llmwiki/`) is a one-way bridge: it imports an `llmwiki export --target json` envelope as one verbatim AtomicMemory record per wiki page, with all advisory metadata (kind, citations, confidence, provenance state, contradictions, aliases, freshness) preserved under `memory.metadata.llmwiki.*`. Either direction holds value standalone; the bridge just lets you choose runtime semantic recall on top of compiled knowledge.

See [`packages/llmwiki/README.md`](packages/llmwiki/README.md) and [`packages/llmwiki/docs/cookbook.md`](packages/llmwiki/docs/cookbook.md) for the full workflow.

## Release Notes

Per-package changelogs live next to each package. Cross-package and monorepo
rollup changes are recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
