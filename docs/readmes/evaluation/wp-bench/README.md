# WP-Bench

The official WordPress AI benchmark. Evaluate how well language models understand WordPress development—from core APIs and coding standards to plugin architecture and security best practices.

## Overview

WP-Bench measures AI model capabilities across two dimensions:

- **Knowledge** — Multiple-choice and short-answer questions testing WordPress concepts, APIs, and best practices
- **Execution** — Code generation tasks graded by static checks and runtime assertions in a real WordPress environment

The benchmark uses WordPress itself as the grader, running generated code in a sandboxed environment with static analysis and runtime assertions.

## Requirements

Requires Python version 3.10 or later

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ./python
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file with your model provider API keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

### 3. Start the WordPress Runtime

```bash
cd runtime
npm install
npm start
```

### 4. Run the Benchmark

```bash
cd ..
wp-bench run --config wp-bench.example.yaml
```

Results are written to `output/results.json` with per-test logs in `output/results.jsonl`.

## Multi-Model Benchmarking

Compare multiple models in a single run by listing them in your config:

```yaml
models:
  - name: gpt-4o
  - name: gpt-4o-mini
  - name: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  - name: claude-opus-4-5-20251101
  - name: gemini/gemini-2.5-pro
  - name: gemini/gemini-2.5-flash
```

The harness runs each model sequentially and outputs a comparison table. Model names follow [LiteLLM conventions](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

## Configuration

Copy `wp-bench.example.yaml` and customize:

```yaml
dataset:
  source: local              # 'local' or 'huggingface'
  name: wp-core-v1           # suite name

models:
  - name: gpt-4o

grader:
  kind: docker
  wp_env_dir: ./runtime      # path to wp-env project
  timeout_seconds: 90        # hard cap per runtime execution (timeout = 0.0 score)
  setup_timeout_seconds: 600 # hard cap for environment setup

run:
  suite: wp-core-v1
  limit: 10                  # limit tests (null = all); seeded stratified selection
  seed: 1337                 # selection seed (same seed = same subset)
  test_ids: []               # optional explicit test IDs to run
  dry_run: false             # load/filter tests without calling models
  concurrency: 4             # model-call concurrency (knowledge tests)
  execution_isolation: reset_per_test  # reset WordPress before each execution test
  execution_concurrency: 1   # must stay 1 under reset_per_test isolation
  continue_on_error: false   # record per-test errors and keep going (diagnostic
                             # only; errored tests are excluded from aggregates)

output:
  path: output/results.json
  jsonl_path: output/results.jsonl
```

### CLI Options

```bash
# Run from project root
wp-bench run --config wp-bench.yaml          # run with config file
wp-bench run --model-name gpt-4o --limit 5   # quick single-model test (stratified subset)
wp-bench run --limit 5 --seed 42             # different deterministic subset
wp-bench run --test-type knowledge           # run only knowledge tests (no WordPress env needed)
wp-bench run --test-type execution           # run only execution tests
wp-bench run --test-type execution --test-id e-abilities-api-001
wp-bench run --test-id e-abilities-api-001 --test-id e-rest-api-001
wp-bench run --config wp-bench.yaml --dry-run # validate config without calling models
wp-bench run --check-reference-solution --test-type execution  # verify reference solutions pass
wp-bench run --check-exploits --test-type execution            # adversarial assertion audit (see below)
```

### Adversarial assertion audit

`--check-reference-solution` proves a correct solution *passes*; `--check-exploits`
proves that trivial cheats *fail*. For every execution test it runs a battery of
zero-effort stubs (an empty function, `return 1`, `return true`, `return array()`, …)
through the real WordPress verifier and flags any test whose assertions a cheat can
satisfy. Such a test is under-specified — its assertions check a predictable output
(one fixture's answer) rather than the WordPress behavior the task describes, so a
model could score on it without doing the work. Exits non-zero if any test is
exploitable; results (with the passing cheat per test) are written to the output file.

```bash
wp-bench run --check-exploits --test-type execution
```

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── python/          # Benchmark harness (pip installable)
├── runtime/         # WordPress grader plugin + wp-env config
├── datasets/        # Test suites (local JSON + Hugging Face builder)
├── notebooks/       # Results visualization and reporting
└── output/          # Benchmark results (gitignored)
```

## Test Suites

Test suites live in `datasets/suites/<suite-name>/` with two directories per suite:

- `execution/` — Code generation tasks with assertions (one JSON file per category)
- `knowledge/` — Multiple-choice and short-answer knowledge questions (one JSON file per category)

The default suite `wp-core-v1` covers WordPress core APIs, hooks, database operations, and security patterns.

### Loading from Hugging Face

```yaml
dataset:
  source: huggingface
  name: WordPress/wp-bench-v1
```

## Results & Reporting

After running benchmarks, visualize results with the included Jupyter notebook:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas plotly
jupyter notebook notebooks/results_report.ipynb
```

The notebook generates:
- Overall scores bar chart
- Knowledge vs Correctness comparison
- Radar chart for top models
- Exportable HTML report

## How Grading Works

1. The harness sends a prompt to the model requesting WordPress code
2. Generated code is sent to the WordPress runtime
3. The runtime performs static analysis (syntax, coding standards, security)
4. Code executes in a sandbox with test assertions
5. Results return as JSON with scores and detailed feedback

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ./python[dev]    # install with dev dependencies
ruff check python/              # lint
mypy python/                    # type check
pytest python/                  # test
```
