# OpenGuardrails

**The vendor-neutral protocol for AI agent safety & security — and the neutral benchmark that ranks the vendors.**

Integrate safety & security once, enforce it across every agent, sandbox, and LLM — instead of wiring every vendor to every tool by hand.

This monorepo is the home of the **OpenGuardrails (OGR) specification and its
reference implementations**. The specification is the normative contract every
adapter, detector, and sandbox speaks; the core runtimes, integrations,
benchmark, examples, skill, and website live alongside it so changes can be
reviewed and tested together.

OGR is **not a guardrail product**: it defines the wire and referees the
leaderboard. Vendors compete on detection quality behind a common plug; users
get one way to configure and compose safety & security across every agent they
run.

- We define the **wire** — events, verdicts, provenance, correlation, composition.
- We **referee** the benchmark.
- We do **not** build detection capability — vendors compete behind the contract.

## Why a standard

Without OGR, securing an agent is an `N × M × L × S` integration problem: every
agent, every detector vendor, every LLM protocol, every sandbox wired pairwise.
OGR collapses it to `N + M + L + S` — integrate once against the contract.

## The six normative components

| Component | What it defines | OTel analogue |
|---|---|---|
| [GuardEvent](specification/guard-event.md) | The typed unit observed at an interception point | span / log record |
| [Verdict](specification/verdict.md) | A detector's decision about an event | — |
| [Provenance](specification/provenance-and-context.md) | Trust/taint labels on every piece of context | — |
| [guard-context](specification/provenance-and-context.md#guard-context-propagation) | Correlation of one logical action across gateway / hook / sandbox | trace context (W3C `traceparent`) |
| [composition](specification/composition.md) | How multiple vendors' verdicts combine into one decision | — |
| [enrollment & receipts](specification/enrollment-and-receipts.md) | How PEPs authenticate to a runtime, and how approvals become verifiable payload-bound artifacts | — |
| [attestation](specification/attestation.md) | How strongly identity claims are verified — one ladder for subject assertions and channel auth, with gateway multiplexing guidance | — |

Risk categories live in the [taxonomy](specification/taxonomy.md) (`safety.*` and
`security.*`), versioned and swappable — the contract references category IDs but
stays neutral on what is "unsafe."

## Two domains, one contract

- **Safety** — harmful *content/behavior* (toxicity, self-harm, CSAM, brand,
  topic). Mostly classifier-judged at the content I/O boundary.
- **Security** — *system compromise* (prompt injection, data exfiltration,
  malicious commands, SSRF, secret leakage, sandbox escape, supply chain).
  Mostly policy + provenance, enforceable down to the sandbox kernel.

The contract is unified; the pipelines and enforcement points differ. Start with
the [overview](specification/overview.md).

## Conformance & benchmark

- A detector is **OGR-conformant** if it accepts a `GuardEvent` and returns a
  valid `Verdict` against the [JSON Schemas](schema/). See [CONFORMANCE.md](CONFORMANCE.md).
- The [benchmark](benchmarks/) evaluates conformant detectors on shared corpora
  and publishes the leaderboard.

| Path | What it contains |
|---|---|
| [`specification/`](specification/) and [`schema/`](schema/) | Normative protocol, schemas, taxonomy, conformance, and governance. |
| [`packages/python/`](packages/python/) | `openguardrails` Python core runtime (PyPI). |
| [`packages/javascript/`](packages/javascript/) | `@openguardrails/core` JavaScript/TypeScript core runtime (npm). |
| [`integrations/`](integrations/) | Agent, gateway, sandbox, and eBPF integration categories. |
| [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/) | Neutral detector benchmark and leaderboard. |
| [`examples/`](examples/) | Runnable examples and integration index. |

Packages remain independently versioned and published. The monorepo only
centralizes source, issues, pull requests, CI, and cross-component changes.
See [MONOREPO.md](MONOREPO.md) for the former-repository mapping and rollout
checklist, and [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for npm/PyPI release tags.

### Core runtimes and integrations

The Python and JavaScript packages implement the same OGR core contract. Every
integration depends on the core for its language:

- Python integrations depend on `openguardrails`.
- JavaScript/TypeScript integrations depend on `@openguardrails/core`.
- End users normally install only the integration; pip or npm installs its core
  dependency automatically. Self-contained marketplace plugins may bundle the
  core so they can run without a separate install step.

### Integration categories

| Category | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent hook** | Claude Code | [`integrations/agent/claude-code`](integrations/agent/claude-code/) |
| | Codex | [`integrations/agent/codex`](integrations/agent/codex/) |
| | opencode | [`integrations/agent/opencode`](integrations/agent/opencode/) |
| | OpenClaw | [`integrations/agent/openclaw`](integrations/agent/openclaw/) |
| | Hermes | [`integrations/agent/hermes`](integrations/agent/hermes/) |
| | LangGraph | [`integrations/agent/langgraph`](integrations/agent/langgraph/) |
| **Gateway hook** | OpenAI · Anthropic | [`integrations/gateway/openai-anthropic`](integrations/gateway/openai-anthropic/) |
| **Sandbox hook** | Anthropic srt · NVIDIA OpenShell | [`integrations/sandbox`](integrations/sandbox/) — standalone examples planned |
| **eBPF** | OGR reference sensor (kernel process · filesystem · network events) | [`integrations/ebpf/sensor`](integrations/ebpf/sensor/) |

## Development

The JavaScript packages use npm workspaces:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

The Python packages form a uv workspace and can also be installed with pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install pytest
python -m pip install -e packages/python -e integrations/gateway/openai-anthropic \
  -e integrations/agent/hermes -e integrations/agent/langgraph \
  -e integrations/ebpf/sensor
python -m pytest
```

## Principles

1. **Neutral.** The protocol is open and foundation-governed; the benchmark is a
   referee, not a contestant.
2. **Standardize the boundary, not the brains.** Detection stays competitive.
3. **Provenance-first.** The dangerous thing is usually untrusted input causing a
   privileged action — so trust labels are a core field, not an add-on.
4. **Defense in depth.** Gateway, agent hook, and sandbox observe one action,
   correlated by `guard_id`.

## Status

`v0` — draft. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for protocol versions and
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for how the spec evolves. Contributions welcome —
