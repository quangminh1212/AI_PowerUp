No existing benchmark measures how well AI can find real people from natural language queries. We built one: 119 queries, 4 scenarios, 3 scoring dimensions, all graded against web evidence — not LLM opinion. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.27476).

| Platform | Relevance Precision | Effective Coverage | Information Utility | Overall |
|----------|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| Lessie | 70.2 | 69.1 | 56.4 | 65.2 |
| Exa | 53.8 | 58.1 | 53.1 | 55.0 |
| Claude Code | 54.3 | 41.1 | 42.7 | 46.0 |
| Juicebox (PeopleGPT) | 44.7 | 41.8 | 50.9 | 45.8 |

<details>
<summary><b>How scores are computed</b></summary>

We extract checkable criteria from each query, verify each returned person against those criteria via web search (Tavily API), and produce a relevance grade (0–1) per person.

- **Relevance Precision** — padded nDCG@10. The ideal DCG assumes 10 perfect results exist, so returning 3 perfect results out of 3 still scores below a platform that returns 10.
- **Effective Coverage** — `TCR × mean(min(qualified / K, 1.0)) × 100`. Qualified = relevance grade >= 0.5.
- **Information Utility** — average of profile completeness, query-specific evidence, and actionability.
- **Overall** — equal-weight mean of the three.

**Platform notes:** Juicebox leads Coverage (75.3) and Utility (55.8) in Recruiting — its 800M-profile database pays off in that vertical, less so outside it. Claude Code gets decent Relevance but returns fewer results, dragging Coverage down. Relevance Precision uses padded nDCG@10: the ideal DCG always assumes 10 perfect results, so platforms returning fewer results are penalized.

## Methodology

```
Query → Extract checkable criteria → Verify each person via web search → Grade → Aggregate
```

Each query is decomposed into concrete criteria. Each returned person is checked against those criteria using live web search — not the LLM's parametric memory. A person matching 2 of 3 criteria scores 0.67.

| Metric | How |
|:-------|:----|
| **Relevance Precision** | Padded nDCG@10 over per-person relevance grades |
| **Effective Coverage** | Task completion rate × qualified yield per query (capped at K=10) |
| **Information Utility** | Mean of completeness, evidence quality, and actionability |
| **Overall** | Equal-weight average |

**Why not LLM-as-Judge?** LLM-as-Judge scores are subjective, prompt-sensitive, and biased toward style over substance. We decompose into binary factual checks verified against live web sources — trading speed for reproducibility.

### Query Design

119 queries across 4 categories, in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch:

| Category | n | What it tests |
|----------|:-:|---------------|
| **Recruiting** | 30 | Skills + experience + location matching |
| **B2B Prospecting** | 32 | Finding decision-makers at target companies |
| **Expert / Deterministic** | 28 | Queries with verifiable correct answers |
| **Influencer / KOL** | 29 | Cross-platform creator discovery |

All queries available in [`data/queries/`](data/queries/).

### Platforms

| Platform | Type | What it searches |

<summary><b>Case 8: UK Film Prop Companies Needing CNC Services</b></summary>

## Data & Reproducibility

This repo contains the query set ([`data/queries/`](data/queries/)), evaluation methodology, and aggregated scores. Raw per-person results are excluded for privacy.

The pipeline: run queries → collect results as CSV → extract criteria per query → verify each person via web search → grade → aggregate into nDCG, Coverage, and Utility scores. Same pipeline, same LLM, applied identically to every platform.

## Disclosure

This benchmark is maintained by [LessieAI](https://lessie.ai), which is also one of the evaluated platforms. Everything is open-source. Scoring relies on external web verification, not our own models. We apply the same pipeline identically to all platforms. [Submit your results](docs/submission_guide.md) if you want to be included.
