# qcai0427/TrustGraphBench

Benchmarking and evaluation resources for trust, robustness, and reliability analysis in graph-based AI systems.

---

# TrustGraphBench

TrustGraphBench is a benchmark-oriented repository for robustness evaluation in graph-aware and structured AI settings.

The project was created around a practical gap in current model evaluation workflows: standard accuracy numbers often say very little about how a system behaves when the input structure is noisy, partially corrupted, adversarially perturbed, or shifted away from clean benchmark assumptions. TrustGraphBench focuses on that gap. Its purpose is to make stress-test style evaluation easier to organize, reproduce, and compare across methods.

Rather than presenting a single model as the center of the repository, TrustGraphBench is organized as an evaluation resource. The emphasis is on benchmark construction, controlled testing conditions, comparative baselines, and experiment workflows that support reliability-focused analysis.

## Project Goals

The current direction of TrustGraphBench includes:

- robustness evaluation under structural perturbation
- benchmark-style testing under noisy and adversarial conditions
- comparison of model behavior beyond standard accuracy metrics
- reproducible experiment settings for trustworthy AI assessment
- reusable workflows for follow-up research and extension

At a higher level, the project asks a simple question: if a model performs well on a clean benchmark, what do we actually know about its reliability once the surrounding structure changes?

## What This Repository Is Meant To Support

TrustGraphBench is intended to support evaluation tasks such as:

- measuring stability under graph or structure-aware perturbations
- comparing baseline and enhanced methods under the same controlled conditions
- testing whether model behavior remains reliable when assumptions about the input are weakened
- organizing benchmark tasks so that experimental results can be repeated and interpreted more easily

The repository is not tied to one narrow downstream task. The underlying idea is broader: robustness evaluation should be treated as a first-class research problem rather than as an optional appendix to standard model performance.

## Repository Direction

Depending on the stage of development, the repository may include:

- benchmark task definitions
- baseline evaluation scripts
- stress-test protocols
- experiment configuration files
- reporting utilities
- example documentation for comparative analysis

The design choice here is intentionally practical. The goal is not to build a large abstraction layer for its own sake, but to provide a usable and public evaluation workspace that can help structure future experiments.

## Status

TrustGraphBench should be viewed as an active benchmark and evaluation resource. It already has a defined scope and a usable identity as a public repository, while continuing to expand as new testing settings and evaluation criteria are incorporated.

This means the repository is not a placeholder for future work, but it is also not frozen. The benchmark layer is expected to evolve as the evaluation framework becomes more mature.

## Intended Audience

TrustGraphBench may be useful for:

- researchers studying trustworthy AI and robustness
- practitioners who want more than a single headline metric
- graph learning or structured prediction researchers interested in failure conditions
- anyone building reproducible evaluation workflows for reliability-focused experiments

## Notes

This repository prioritizes clear evaluation design over excessive complexity. Where possible, benchmark components are organized to remain understandable, modifiable, and easy to reuse in adjacent research settings.
