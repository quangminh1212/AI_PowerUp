A novel approach to evaluating AI agents on diagnostic accuracy in symptom checking tasks.

# MedAsk Benchmarks

A comprehensive suite of medical AI benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) performance on clinical tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains multiple medical AI benchmarks developed by MedAsk to evaluate and compare the performance of LLMs on various medical tasks:

### 🩺 SymptomCheck Bench
An OSCE-style benchmark for evaluating diagnostic accuracy of LLM-based medical agents in symptom assessment conversations. The benchmark simulates medical consultations through a structured four-step process:
1. Initialization: Selection of a clinical vignette  
2. Dialogue: Simulated conversation between an LLM agent and patient
3. Diagnosis: Generation of top 5 differential diagnoses
4. Evaluation: Automated assessment of diagnostic accuracy

### 🚨 Triage Bench  
A benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on medical triage classification tasks. Models classify clinical vignettes into three urgency levels:
- **Emergency (em)**: Requires immediate emergency room attention
- **Non-Emergency (ne)**: Needs medical evaluation within a week  
- **Self-care (sc)**: Can be managed with self-care and monitoring
