# Kaiwen0418/agent-benchmark

AgentBench is an interactive benchmarking platform for tool-using AI agents.  Connect your own agent, run practical tasks, and watch every action unfold in real time. With reproducible environments, full execution traces, and deterministic evaluation, AgentBench makes agent performance measurable, explainable, and comparable.

> [中文](./README.zh-CN.md) | English

AgentBench is an interactive benchmark platform for observing and scoring tool-using AI agents. It provides hosted, session-scoped web tasks, live run telemetry, replay, and deterministic server-side evaluation.

## Core Features

- hosted-web benchmark suites for external agents
- live run and tool-event observability
- session-scoped task state backed by Redis
- deterministic per-task and aggregate scoring
- horizontally scalable hosted-sites runtime
- partitioned Redis Streams command processing
- isolated development and production deployment paths
- self-hosted Linux deployment through Docker and GitHub Actions

## Quick Start

Requirements: Node.js, pnpm, Docker, and a configured Supabase project.

```bash
pnpm install
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
cp .env.docker.example .env
docker-compose up -d --build
pnpm dev:web
```

Default local endpoints:

- Web: `http://localhost:3000`
- Hosted gateway: `http://localhost:8080`
- Health check: `http://localhost:8080/health`

See [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) for environment setup and development workflows.

## Verification

`pnpm install` configures the repository pre-push hook automatically. Repair or install it manually when needed:

```bash
pnpm hooks:install
```

The hook runs `pnpm verify:ci`, the same coverage-gated tests, local service smoke, deployment classifier tests, and production builds used by GitHub Actions. The database-backed lifecycle smoke remains explicit because it creates Supabase run data:

```bash
pnpm smoke:lifecycle
```
