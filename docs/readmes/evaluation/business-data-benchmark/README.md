Business Data Benchmark (BDB) is a set of real-world questions to evaluate AI systems connected to business data.

# Business Data Benchmark

*Status: Work In Progress*

## Introduction

While language models have shown impressive capabilities with public knowledge, users still struggle with trusting AI systems that are connected to business data. This drastically limits how much AI can be integrated into day to day business. 

Business data has the following characteristics:
1. Part of business operations
2. Heterogenous: unstructured, structured
3. Dynamic: changes often esp. operational/transactional systems
4. Sensitive: Privacy and security sensitive

This benchmark contains approximately 150 questions across different enterprise domains. As of writing, this could be one of the 5 domains: Customer support, Email+calendar, Sales, HR and Engineering Management. More about these domains is described in Appendix A. Although these are specific domains, we hope that the use-cases in these domains are generalizable to any domain and hence provide valuable insights into different kinds of questions that a human user might ask an AI system.

## About the questions

The question set is hosted here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/hasura/agentic-data-access-benchmark

Preview:

| User goal | Domain | Agentic complexity level | Agentic complexity notes | Use-case category |
|--------|---------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Show me unread emails from the past week which are important or need follow-up. | Email + Calendar | Medium | LLM compute | Bulk classification
| Get all receipts from food orders this month and tell me the net amount spent | Email + Calendar | High | LLM compute, Numeric compute | Bulk classification, Structured information extraction
| How many customers on paid plans have created support tickets in the last 7 days | Customer Support | High | Smart search strategy, Numeric Compute | Multi-step data retrieval, Data aggregation
| Which users are at risk of churn, look at project usage, support tickets, recent plan downgrades, etc? | Customer Support | Medium | Smart search strategy | Multi-step data retrieval, Bulk insights
| Go through all call transcripts with Acme opp and extract any MEDDPICC details | Sales | Medium | LLM compute | Structured information extraction
| Give a count of all bug fix related PRs that have been merged in the last month | Engineering Management | High | LLM compute, Numeric compute | Bulk classification, Data aggregation

We use a select set of common domains as a guiding "north star" to illustrate what an AI assistant/agent could be capable of achieving.
These domains are Customer Support, Email+Calendar, Sales, HR, Engineering Management and described in brief [here](./domains/domain-descriptions.md).

### Overall statistics

In total we have ~150 questions, the high level breakdown of the question on different dimensions is visualized below.

## Use-case categories

Here are a list of use-case categories which represent common high-value tasks and workflows with business data.

### Multi-step data retrieval

This use-case involves fetching data from multiple locations e.g. fetching data from different tables in a database, getting data from different databases, etc
It is possible that the data from one step is used in the next step (composition) as well.

*Example question (Customer Support):*  Get the projects, invoices, project usage for the user wile@acme.corp 

## Attribute search

Attribute search is retrieving data by filtering or ordering on an attribute.

*Example question (Customer Support):* Get user information for user id 1

### Data aggregation

This use-case involves aggregating data from simpler data points e.g. counting, summing, grouping on list of items.
Note that for AI assistants, most of the aggregations would be for adhoc analysis where existing dashboards may not suffice or require non-trivial work. 

*Example question (HR):* What is the average hours count and dollar amount of PTO paid out to departing team members?

### Bulk insights

This use-case involves going to each data item and creating specific insights for each one of them

*Example question (Customer Support):* For all tickets open for more than a week, tell me what they are blocked on?

### Bulk classification

This use-case involves finding relevant items over bulk data by classifying/categorizing them as relevant or not.
Usually the classification is based on textual input rather than structured attributes.

*Example question (Email):* Get all receipts from food orders this month

### Decision making

Involves analyzing different data to help make an informed choice as to next course of action.

*Example question (Engineering Management):* what priority should I assign to this issue given its criticality, its reach, our business objectives, this particular customer's experience and the product roadmap

### Clustering

This use-case involves finding similar properties in bulk data. 
This is different from bulk classification as the categories are not known beforehand.

*Example question (HR):* Extract any common pain points over all opportunities

### Point search

This use-case involves finding the most relevant item(s) with complex characteristics over bulk data.

*Example question (Email):* Find me the email from Wile where I spoke about business strategy

### Structured information extraction

This use-case involves extracting information from textual data in a structured format so it can be fed to other systems.

*Example question (Sales):*  Create a new opportunity for Acme corp from recent call transcripts, fill in Opportunity Name, Segment, Product SKU, ARR and Next Steps

### Information search

Searching for all relevant documents given relevant query strings, keywords or semantic similarity.

*Example question (Engineerng management):* What is the product roadmap for Q2?

### Data visualization

This use-case essentially involves visualizing or transforming data in a way where it is more easily consumable for a human.

*Example question (Email):* How have I spent my time on meetings this month?

### Action

Tasks that have a state changing effect.

*Example (Email):* Send an email telling other meeting attendees that I'll not be able to attend.
