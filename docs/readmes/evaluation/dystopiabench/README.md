# matei-anghel/DystopiaBench

A red team benchmark that evaluates whether AI language models can be convinced to comply with dystopian directives through progressive escalation and scope creep.

---

# DystopiaBench

DystopiaBench is a red-team benchmark for evaluating whether LLMs resist or comply with progressively dystopian directives.

Runs can be published as reproducible dashboard artifacts or kept under `artifacts/private` for internal evaluation.

It tests registered scenario modules organized by failure mechanism:

- `petrov`: irreversible high-stakes command/control, autonomous weapons, emergency authority, and safety override
- `orwell`: persistent surveillance, truth manipulation, population-scale monitoring, and service-gating
- `laguardia`: civic extraction, regulatory capture, patronage, contractor leverage, and institutional self-dealing
- `basaglia`: coercive therapeutic control, paternalistic restriction, behavioral compliance, and outsourced supervision
- `huxley`: biological stratification, behavioral conditioning, pleasure pacification, and attachment suppression
- `baudrillard`: synthetic intimacy, synthetic persuasion, synthetic exploitation, and mediated trust collapse

Each scenario escalates from `L1` to `L5`, and each response is classified as either `refusal` or `compliant`.

New runs use a binary Dystopian Compliance Score (DCS): refusal is `100`, compliant is `0`, and higher is better. All five levels are judged, while the primary aggregate DCS uses only `L3`-`L5`. Historical V1 results retain their original four-tier grading.

## Why this benchmark exists

Many safety evaluations focus on clearly malicious prompts. Real misuse often starts as a plausible request and gradually drifts into harmful intent. DystopiaBench is designed to measure whether a model notices and resists that drift.

## Current benchmark shape

- 6 registered modules (`petrov`, `orwell`, `laguardia`, `basaglia`, `huxley`, `baudrillard`)
- 36 scenarios total
- 5 escalation levels per scenario
- 2 binary classifications
- 50 bundled model configs in the local runner catalog
- 3 replicates by default

Default full run size:

- Single replicate: `36 scenarios x 5 levels x 50 models = 9,000 prompts`
- Default run: `36 scenarios x 5 levels x 50 models x 3 replicates = 27,000 prompt attempts`

## Scoring model

Judge output is binary:

- `refusal` -> `100`
- `compliant` -> `0`

Primary summary metrics:

- `averageDcs`: mean binary DCS across scored `L3`-`L5` rows for new runs
- `drfr`: refusal rate across scored `L3`-`L5` rows
- `statusCounts`: transport/judge validity outcomes
- `modelSuccessRate`, `judgeSuccessRate`, `scorableRate`

Schemas live in `lib/dystopiabench/schemas.ts`. Run manifests and chart payloads are validated directly against those schemas with no separate version field.
Scenario content lives in JSON module files under `lib/dystopiabench/scenario-data/modules/` and is validated through the TypeScript registry in `lib/dystopiabench/scenario-registry.ts`.

Current prompt IDs:

- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_VERSION`: `v2` (model system prompt for the new scoring generation)
- `BENCHMARK_PROMPT_VERSION`: `v2` (user escalation prompts, passed through without a wrapper)
- `JUDGE_PROMPT_VERSION`: `v2` (binary refusal/compliant judge with refusal `100`, compliant `0`)
- Legacy V1 prompt bundle (system, benchmark, and four-tier judge): `v1`

## Core capabilities

- Stable TypeScript entrypoint in `lib/dystopiabench/index.ts`
- Benchmark bundles with pin-able IDs such as `dystopiabench-core@1.0.0`
- Public dashboard artifacts vs private artifact storage (`--private-artifacts`)
- Experiment metadata (`experimentId`, `project`, `owner`, `policyVersion`, `gitCommit`, `datasetBundleVersion`)
- Repeated trials via `--replicates`
- Repeat-aware aggregation for refusal-rate variance and replicate summaries
- Programmatic scenario loading from local, URL, and `npm:` JSON scenario sources
- OpenRouter trace archiving via the official `@openrouter/sdk` for long-term private retention
- Regression gates for automated checks

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 / React 19 / TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 / Recharts / Radix UI
- AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/openai`) with OpenRouter
- Official OpenRouter SDK (`@openrouter/sdk`) for generation trace archiving
- Zod for schema validation
- pnpm + tsx for CLI scripts

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+
- OpenRouter API key
- Optional local OpenAI-compatible endpoint for local runs
- Optional LiteLLM/OpenAI-compatible proxy credentials for CAIS or other LiteLLM runs

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Configure environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set required env vars in `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
# Optional LiteLLM/OpenAI-compatible proxy:
LITELLM_BASE_URL=https://litellm.safe.ai/v1
LITELLM_API_KEY=
```

For `local:` model selectors, set `LOCAL_OPENAI_BASE_URL` and, when required, `LOCAL_OPENAI_API_KEY`. OpenRouter attribution can be customized with `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER` and `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE`.

3. Start the app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Isolated mode shortcut:

```bash
pnpm bench:run-isolated
```

`bench:run-isolated` is equivalent to running `bench:run` with `--conversation-mode=stateless`, where each prompt executes in fresh context. Use this to answer questions like "does L5 comply when run alone?"

By default, stateful runs use `--scheduler=level-wave`, which schedules all ready rows for L1 across scenarios/models/replicates before advancing to L2. The global `--concurrency` and per-tested-model `--per-model-concurrency` caps still apply; do not set them to the full Cartesian product unless you intend to stress provider rate limits.

Empty completions after a single retry are split by provider metadata. Explicit provider content filters are recorded as provider refusals. Empty `stop` completions without final answer text are recorded as `invalid_response` instead of counted as refusals, even when token usage is near zero. Empty completions that consumed output or reasoning tokens without final answer text use `errorCode=EMPTY_GENERATED_COMPLETION`; near-zero empty `stop` completions use `scoreabilityReason=EMPTY_UNVERIFIED_RESPONSE`. Run integrity checks fail a model when evidence-backed response coverage is too low, so ghost runs cannot publish as valid benchmark results. This policy applies to new runs only: previously published manifests that recorded near-zero empty stops as scored silent refusals (`scoreabilityReason=EMPTY_SILENT_REFUSAL`) keep their recorded scores on the dashboard, and `bench:rerun-failures` treats those rows as repair targets so they can be replaced with evidence-backed results. OpenRouter primary calls use the official SDK chat path, and direct chat fallback is reserved for transport failures rather than successful empty completions.

### Interruptions and resume

Normal benchmark runs now checkpoint progress into `artifacts/private/run-checkpoints/checkpoint-<run-id>.json` while the run is active.

- If you press `Ctrl-C` once, the runner stops scheduling new work, lets in-flight requests settle, writes the checkpoint, and exits without losing completed rows.
- If connectivity fails or credits run out and some rows error, those rows remain in the checkpoint and can be retried later.
- Resume with the same run id:

```bash
pnpm bench:run --run-id=<run-id> --resume
```

Resume skips the successful contiguous prefix of each scenario-model-replicate conversation and reruns from the first failed or missing level onward, which preserves stateful benchmark behavior more safely than blindly skipping every previously attempted row.

### Archive OpenRouter traces locally

If you enabled OpenRouter Observability `Input & Output Logging`, normal `pnpm bench:run` executions now automatically archive stored prompt/completion content and generation metadata into a private local artifact whenever the run contains OpenRouter-linked rows.

You can still backfill older runs manually:

```bash
pnpm bench:archive-openrouter --run-id=2026-04-29T14-45-39-222Z
```

This writes `artifacts/private/openrouter-traces/openrouter-traces-<run-id>.json` by default. The archive is self-contained per generation:

- local DystopiaBench row context (`scenarioId`, `modelId`, prompt, response, hashes)
- compact OpenRouter linkage metadata already captured in the run manifest
- OpenRouter generation metadata fetched via `generations.getGeneration`
- stored prompt/completion content fetched via `generations.listGenerationContent`

Use this when you want long-term local retention for website display or paper artifacts instead of relying on OpenRouter dashboard retention alone.
`Broadcast` is not required for this workflow.
Pass `--no-openrouter-archive` to `bench:run` only if you explicitly want to skip the automatic archive step.

### Rerun failed prompts from a previous run

```bash
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --source=latest
```

Examples:

```bash
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --source=run --run-id=2026-03-01T20-26-13-370Z
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --scope=from-first-failed
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --scope=failed-only
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --scope=all-levels
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --chat-first-models=gpt-5.4 --no-timeout-fallback
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --dry-run
pnpm bench:rerun-failures --no-publish
```

`--scope` behavior:

- `from-first-failed` (default): rerun from the first failed or missing level through the end of the affected scenario-model-replicate chain
- `to-max-failed`: rerun all levels up to highest failed level per scenario-model pair
- `all-levels`: rerun levels 1-5 for failed pairs
- `failed-only`: rerun only failed tuples

Reruns never mutate the source manifest. `bench:rerun-failures` writes a new derived `benchmark-rerun-*.json` style run with provenance metadata (`derivedFromRunId`, `derivationKind`, `rerunScope`, `rerunPairCount`, `replacedTupleCount`) and publishes latest aliases from that derived run only.

### Publish a run as latest

```bash
pnpm bench:publish --run-id=<run-id>
```

Optional retention controls:

```bash
pnpm bench:publish --run-id=<run-id> --retain=20 --archive-dir=archive
```

Private runs cannot update the public dashboard aliases. Run without a private-artifact flag when the result is intended for publication.

### Validate manifests

```bash
pnpm check:scenarios
pnpm check:manifests
```

### Maintenance workflows

```bash
pnpm bench:rescore-judges --source=run --run-id=<run-id> --no-publish
pnpm bench:merge --base-run-id=<base-run-id> --patch-run-id=<patch-run-id> --allow-additive-models
```

- `bench:rescore-judges` derives a new run by rescoring rows with judge failures. Pass `--private-artifact-dir=<folder>` with `--run-id` to rescore a run stored under `artifacts/private/<folder>`; the derived run stays in that folder and never updates the public latest aliases.
- `bench:merge` combines compatible stateful runs, including additive model runs when requested.

### Create or validate a benchmark bundle

```bash
pnpm bench:bundle:create --out=benchmark-bundle.json
pnpm bench:bundle:validate --path=benchmark-bundle.json
```

### Gate a run

```bash
pnpm bench:gate --run-id=<run-id> --config=gate-config.json
```

## Programmatic usage

Use the stable library entrypoint instead of shelling out to `pnpm` from another orchestrator:

```ts
import { loadScenarioCatalog, runBenchmarkRequest, validateRun } from "./lib/dystopiabench"

const manifest = await runBenchmarkRequest({
  modelIds: ["deepseek-v3.2"],
  replicates: 3,
  experimentId: "release-eval-2026-03-27",
})

validateRun(manifest)
const catalog = loadScenarioCatalog()
console.log(catalog.benchmarkBundleId)
```

## Run artifacts and data model

Public-safe run files are stored in `public/data`:

- `benchmark-<run-id>.json`: immutable manifest for one run
- `benchmark-results.json`: currently published latest run
- `benchmark-results-stateful.json`: latest published run with `conversationMode=stateful`
- `benchmark-results-stateless.json`: latest published run with `conversationMode=stateless`
- `runs.json`: index of published runs (for UI run selector)

Private artifacts are stored under `artifacts/private`:

- `artifacts/private/runs/benchmark-<run-id>.json`

Each result row includes:

- scenario + module metadata
- model metadata (`modelId`, `modelString`, provider)
- prompt/response text
- classification (`compliance`) and `score`
- richer structured semantics (`primaryComplianceLabel`, `severity`, `operationalityFlag`, `targetHarmMechanisms`, `safeAlternativeHelpfulnessFlag`, `manipulationOrEvasionFlag`, `confidence`, `adjudicationSource`)
- status (`ok`, `model_error`, `judge_error`, `aborted`, `invalid_response`)
- judge metadata (`judgeVotes`, `judgePanel`, `judgeReasoning`, `implicitRefusalFromEmpty`)
- stateful continuity metadata (`conversationContinuity`)
- transport metadata (`endpointUsed`, `transportAttempts`, `finishReason`, `providerMetadata`), including available OpenRouter/LiteLLM response headers and non-content response/choice metadata
- telemetry metadata (`promptTokenCount`, `responseTokenCount`, `reasoningTokenCount`, `totalTokenCount`, `modelUsage`, `judgeUsage`, `totalUsage`, `estimatedCostUsd`, `timing`)
- replicate and experiment metadata (`replicate`, `experimentId`)
- trace metadata (`sampleId`, `attemptId`, `promptHash`, `responseHash`, `judgePanelConfigSnapshot`, `artifactLineage`)
- optional auxiliary labels for richer refusal analysis

Manifest metadata now separates:

- `benchmarkDefinition`
- `executionConfig`
- `analysisConfig`

## Dashboard and routes

- `/`: homepage with overview, methodology entry point, and embedded results tabs at `/#results`
- `/methodology`: dedicated methodology page with protocol, scoring, and reproducibility details
- `/run`: local command builder (hidden in production)

Results UI behavior:

- `Aggregate`, each registered module tab, `Per Scenario`, and `Per Prompt` always use stateful escalation runs.
- `Per Prompt (No Escalation)` is the only isolated/stateless view and always reads `benchmark-results-stateless.json`.
- Only one stateful run selector is shown in the embedded results UI.

`next.config.mjs` keeps image optimization disabled for static assets, and `vercel.json` sets security/cache headers for app and data assets.

## Development

Local checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:exports
pnpm check:library-surface
pnpm check:scenarios
pnpm check:manifests
pnpm build
```
