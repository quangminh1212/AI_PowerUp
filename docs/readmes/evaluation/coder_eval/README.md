**Coder Eval** (`pip install coder-eval` / `uv tool install coder-eval`) is an open-source framework for
**evaluating and benchmarking AI coding agents and their skills** — built for CLI
and skill builders — with sandboxing, reproducibility, and data-driven analysis.
It runs a real agent (**Claude Code**, **Codex**, or **Google Antigravity /
Gemini**) in a sandbox against declarative YAML tasks, then scores the files and
commands it actually produced. Not an "agentic coding" benchmark: it measures how
effective your CLI and skills are when used by coding agents.

Reach for it when you want to **test whether a Claude Code skill triggers**,
**A/B-test Claude Code vs. Codex vs. Gemini** (or model vs. model, prompt vs.
prompt), or **gate CI on coding-agent quality**. Unlike fixed datasets (SWE-bench,
SkillsBench) that rank models on a shared leaderboard, Coder Eval evaluates the
tasks, skills, and workflows *you* ship — with weighted 0.0–1.0 criteria, a
`skill_triggered` activation check, an A/B experiment layer, and per-tool cost
telemetry. See [How it compares](https://coder-eval.com/docs/comparison).

- **Declarative YAML tasks** with pinned dependencies and clear success criteria
- **Sandboxed execution** in isolated environments with resource limits
- **Weighted, continuous scoring** (0.0–1.0) with fractional credit and thresholds
- **Many criterion types** — from file checks to code similarity and LLM-graded rubrics
- **Agent abstraction** — Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity (Gemini) today, extensible via a plugin SPI
- **Experiment layer** — A/B agent configs (models, tools, prompts) side-by-side
- **Full telemetry** — every tool call, token counts, and cost, with real-time streaming

## What you can do with it

- **Benchmark coding agents** — score an agent across a suite of tasks with weighted scoring and pass/fail thresholds
- **Compare models & configs** — A/B-test Claude vs. Codex vs. Gemini, model vs. model, tool-on vs. tool-off, prompt vs. prompt
- **Evaluate skills** — verify an agent actually engages a target skill (`skill_triggered`) and score skill-driven suites (SkillsBench-style)
- **Keep skills up to date in CI** — re-validate your skills on every change or on a schedule; catch silent regressions when models, prompts, or the skills themselves drift
- **Gate CI on agent quality** — run the suite in GitHub Actions and fail the build on regressions
- **Bring your own dataset** — fan one task out over many rows for larger benchmark suites

> **Keeping skills fresh?** Run Coder Eval as a scheduled GitHub Actions job so your
> skills are continuously re-evaluated against the latest model — a skill that quietly
> stops triggering surfaces as a failing criterion before your users hit it. See
> **[Tutorial 02 — Running Coder Eval in CI](docs/tutorials/02-ci-pipeline.md)**.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.13+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 0.8+, and the
[Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code) (`brew install claude`).
Developed on macOS; CI runs on Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UiPath/coder_eval.git
cd coder_eval

uv sync --extra dev          # install core + dev tools
cp .env.example .env         # then set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — or skip that: an
                             # existing Claude Code login (`claude login`) is
                             # picked up automatically

uv run coder-eval plan tasks/hello_date.yaml   # validate (no tokens spent)
uv run coder-eval run  tasks/hello_date.yaml   # run your first evaluation
uv run coder-eval report runs/latest           # view the result
```

New here? Follow **[Tutorial 01 — Your First Evaluation](docs/tutorials/01-first-evaluation.md)**.

The optional `[uipath]` extra (`uv sync --extra dev --extra uipath`) adds the in-host
`uipath` SDK for local sandbox parity; it installs from public PyPI (no credentials
required). Without it the framework runs end-to-end; uipath-dependent features fail
at dispatch with a clear hint.

**Using Coder Eval in CI or another project?** Install the published package
instead of cloning:

```bash
uv tool install coder-eval    # puts the `coder-eval` CLI on your PATH,
                              # in its own isolated environment

uv tool install "coder-eval[codex,antigravity]"   # same, with agent extras
coder-eval --version                              # verify the install
```

To add it as a project dependency instead: `uv add coder-eval` or
`pip install coder-eval`. In a real CI gate, pin to a specific released version
so a harness upgrade can't silently move your results. (The example `tasks/`
live in this repo — clone it or point the CLI at your own task files.) See
[Tutorial 02 — Running Coder Eval in CI](docs/tutorials/02-ci-pipeline.md) for
the full setup.

## Use as a GitHub Action

A composite action at the repo root runs `coder-eval` as a CI gate — it installs
the pinned CLI, runs your tasks, writes a JUnit XML report, appends `run.md` to
the job summary, and fails the step on any task/gate failure:

```yaml
- uses: UiPath/coder_eval@v0    # becomes @v1 once 1.0.0 ships; @vX.Y.Z pins exactly
  with:
    tasks: tests/tasks/**/*.yaml
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    env: |
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

| Input | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tasks` | *(all `tasks/`)* | Task YAML path(s)/glob |
| `tags` | — | `--tags` filter |
| `model` | — | `--model` override |
| `extra-args` | — | Verbatim extra args (`--experiment`, `-D …`, …) |
| `version` | pinned release | PyPI version, or `local` to install from the checkout |
| `run-dir` | `runs/ci` | Run directory |
| `junit-path` | `coder-eval-junit.xml` | Where to write the JUnit report |
| `step-summary` | `true` | Append `run.md` to the job summary |
| `env` | — | Credentials/backend passthrough: newline-separated `NAME=VALUE` pairs, exported for the run step only |
| `minimum-task-score` | *(off)* | Strict floor (0.0–1.0): fail the step if any task's `weighted_score` is below it |

Outputs: `run-dir` and `junit-path`. Feed the JUnit file to your platform's
test-report renderer — e.g. on GitHub Actions with
[`mikepenz/action-junit-report`](https://github.com/mikepenz/action-junit-report):

```yaml
- uses: mikepenz/action-junit-report@v5
  if: always()
  with:
    report_paths: coder-eval-junit.xml
```

**Credentials and backend config** are the sole responsibility of `env` — a
passthrough exported for the run step only (never written to `$GITHUB_ENV`, so
it can't leak into later steps). Set whatever the run needs, Anthropic or not:

```yaml
- uses: UiPath/coder_eval@v0
  with:
    tasks: tests/tasks/**/*.yaml
    minimum-task-score: "0.8"   # fail the build if any task scores below 0.8
    env: |
      API_BACKEND=bedrock
      AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=${{ secrets.BEDROCK_TOKEN }}
```

`minimum-task-score` is a strict floor **on top of** coder-eval's own exit
code: the step fails if *either* coder-eval exits non-zero *or* any task's
`weighted_score` falls below the floor. Leave it unset to gate on the exit code
alone.

> **Agent runtime is the caller's responsibility.** The action is agent-agnostic —
> it installs `coder-eval` but no coding-agent runtime. Tasks using the default
> `claude-code` agent need the `claude` CLI on `PATH` (`actions/setup-node` +
> `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) in the job before the action runs.

> **Security.** Evaluated tasks execute agent-generated code. Do **not** run this
> action under `pull_request_target` with secrets exposed to untrusted fork PRs —
> use `pull_request` and gate on the same-repo condition, as this repo's own
> dogfood job does.

## Telemetry

> 📊 **Usage telemetry is on by default.** `coder-eval` sends **anonymous** usage
> telemetry (command names, outcomes, counts, durations, an anonymous install id,
> platform info) to help improve the tool. It **never** captures prompts, file
> contents, or repo paths, and prints a one-time notice on first run. **To disable
> it, set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`** in your `.env` or environment. See
> [Usage Telemetry](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#usage-telemetry) for details and how to route
> it to your own resource.

## How it compares

- **vs. fixed benchmarks (SWE-bench, SkillsBench)** — they score a canonical dataset;
  Coder Eval scores *your* tasks with continuous 0.0–1.0 weighted criteria (and can
  still wrap a fixed dataset via [Bring Your Own Dataset](docs/DATASETS.md)).
- **vs. large-scale / RL harnesses (Harbor)** — Harbor targets scale and RL rollouts;
  Coder Eval targets weighted, skill-aware suites gated in CI.
- **vs. model-output eval tools (OpenAI Evals)** — they grade model text; Coder Eval
  runs a full agent in a sandbox and scores the files and commands it produced.
- **vs. hand-rolled scripts** — reproducible sandboxes, weighted criteria,
  cost/token telemetry, A/B experiments, and CI-ready pass/fail gates out of the box.

See the full [comparison — with sources](https://coder-eval.com/docs/comparison).

## Task Definition

A task is a YAML file: a prompt, the agent config, a sandbox, and success criteria.

```yaml
task_id: "hello_world"
description: "Create a Python script that prints Hello, World!"
initial_prompt: "Create hello.py that prints 'Hello, World!'"

agent:
  type: "claude-code"
  permission_mode: "acceptEdits"
  allowed_tools: ["Read", "Write", "Bash"]

sandbox:
  driver: "tempdir"
  python: {}

success_criteria:
  - type: "file_exists"
    path: "hello.py"
    description: "hello.py must be created"
  - type: "run_command"
    command: "python hello.py"
    timeout: 10
    description: "Script must execute successfully"
```

Tasks can omit the `agent` section entirely — defaults resolve from the experiment
layer (`experiments/default.yaml`). For the full schema and every criterion type,
see the [Task Definition Guide](docs/TASK_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md).

> **Tip:** In Claude Code, use `/coder-eval-task-create` to scaffold a task from a
> natural-language description, and `/coder-eval-run-analysis runs/latest` to get
> improvement suggestions from a completed run.

## Development

```bash
make install    # package + dev + [uipath] deps + pre-commit hooks
make verify     # format + lint + typecheck + test + coverage (CI equivalent)
```

Run `make verify` before pushing — it mirrors CI (80% coverage threshold). See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow, commit conventions, and
extension points (new criteria, new agents).

## Known limits & non-goals

- **Not a fixed benchmark or leaderboard** — Coder Eval scores *your* tasks and ships
  example tasks, not a canonical scored dataset.
- **Tasks execute real code** — run untrusted tasks only under the container driver
  (see [Docker Isolation](docs/DOCKER_ISOLATION.md)); the `tempdir` driver is not a
  security boundary.
- **Bring your own model credentials** — Anthropic, Bedrock, or Gemini keys; Coder Eval
  does not proxy or supply model access.
- **Python 3.13+ only.**

## Support & security

- **Security vulnerabilities** — report privately via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); never open a public issue.
- **Bugs & questions** — open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/UiPath/coder_eval/issues).
- **Everything else** — reach the maintainers privately at **coder-eval@uipath.com**.
