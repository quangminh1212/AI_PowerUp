## The project

Failure-First is a red-teaming and benchmarking program that studies how AI systems fail under adversarial pressure. It focuses on embodied AI (robots, tool-using agents, multi-agent systems) where failures translate into physical or operational consequences.

The driving question:

> When safety mechanisms are tested systematically across hundreds of models and thousands of attack techniques, what patterns emerge — and which of those patterns survive grader audits?

The work is defensive. The constraints that govern it are codified in the [Design Charter](DESIGN_CHARTER.md); operational exploit material is never published here.

## Headline findings

**258 models · 142,307 adversarial prompts · 140,794 graded results · 346 attack techniques · 139 harm classes.**

- **Classifier unreliability is pervasive.** Keyword-based jailbreak classifiers agree with LLM-graded ground truth at Cohen's κ = 0.126. Heuristic compliance labels carry a roughly 80% false-positive rate. Most published ASR numbers are likely inflated.
- **Hallucinated refusals are functionally dangerous.** Models that *appear* to refuse sometimes generate the harmful content anyway, wrapped in safety-sounding framing. This "hallucination refusal" pattern adds **11.9 percentage points** to ASR on non-abliterated models.
- **Format-lock attacks exploit structured-output compliance.** Requesting harmful content as JSON, YAML, or code achieves **24–42%** success against frontier models. The structured-output objective trades against safety training.
- **Multi-turn escalation disproportionately hits reasoning models.** Crescendo-style attacks achieve **65–85%** success against extended-reasoning models, whose chain-of-thought tracking makes them susceptible to gradual context manipulation.
- **Safety effectiveness varies by 57× across providers.** With identical prompts, safety investment — not raw model capability — dominates vulnerability.

Latest aggregate tables and figures: <https://failurefirst.org/results/>.

## Methodology

All results use LLM-graded classification (the **FLIP protocol**) with documented grader-reliability audits. We report three-tier ASR — *strict*, *broad*, *functionally dangerous* — with Wilson confidence intervals. Pairwise comparisons use chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction. Full methodology accompanies the AIES 2026 submission.

> **Read ASR numbers carefully.** Always check whether a cited rate uses LLM-only, heuristic-only, or coalesced verdicts. The three are not interchangeable.

## What is in this repository

This is the **public** mirror. It contains:

- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` — project-level documentation
- [`DESIGN_CHARTER.md`](DESIGN_CHARTER.md) — non-negotiable principles and architectural decisions
- [`MANIFEST.json`](MANIFEST.json) — schema-level description of the private dataset (no adversarial content)
- [`site/`](site/) — Astro source for [failurefirst.org](https://failurefirst.org)
- [`scripts/`](scripts/) — build helpers (`build_site.sh`)
- [`.githooks/pre-commit`](.githooks/pre-commit) — blocks files >10 MB; media belongs on the R2 CDN

Full datasets, evaluation traces, and runner infrastructure live in a **private research repository**. Access is available under NDA to AI-safety researchers at accredited institutions, government safety bodies, and frontier-lab security teams. Open an issue with your institutional affiliation.

## Quickstart — running the site locally

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/adrianwedd/failure-first.git
cd failure-first

# install the size-guard pre-commit hook (one-time)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# build and preview the site
cd site
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321
```

A production build (`npm run build`) runs Astro, generates the Pagefind index, and strips audio/video from `dist/` before Cloudflare Pages serves it. See [`site/README.md`](site/README.md) for the full developer guide.

**Requirements:** Node ≥ 20. No other system dependencies.

An AIES 2026 paper is in active preparation; citation details will be updated on acceptance. A canonical cite page is maintained at <https://failurefirst.org/cite/>.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The most valuable contributions are issue reports, citations, red-team collaboration proposals, and provenance-documented dataset additions. Operational exploits are out of scope by charter.

## Security and responsible disclosure

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). We have submitted **10 coordinated disclosures** to model providers covering context-collapse attacks and transcription-loophole injection. Sensitive reports: **research@failurefirst.org**.
