# Part 1: Framework Overview

## What is CORE-EEAT?

CORE-EEAT is a content quality benchmark for the AI era. It evaluates content across two complementary systems:

| System | Optimization Target | Core Question | Items |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| **CORE** | GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) | Can AI understand, extract, and cite this content? | 40 |
| **EEAT** | SEO (Search Engine Optimization) | Is the source behind this content trustworthy? | 40 |
| **Total** | GEO + SEO | — | **80** |

### MECE Boundary

The two systems are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive:

- **CORE** = the content body itself — *What does it say? How is it organized? Can AI cite it?*
- **EEAT** = everything outside the content body — *Who wrote it? Why should we trust them?*

**Quick rule**: If you can see it in the article/page → CORE. If you need to check the author/org/site → EEAT.

### CORE-EEAT + CITE: The Complete Picture

CORE-EEAT evaluates content; its sister project [CITE Domain Rating](../cite-domain-rating/) evaluates the domain behind the content. Together they form a complete 120-item assessment:

| Benchmark | Evaluates | Level | Items | Core Question |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **CORE-EEAT** | Content quality | Single page/article | 80 | Is this content worth citing? |
| **CITE** | Domain authority | Entire domain | 40 | Is this domain worth trusting as a source? |
| **Combined** | Full assessment | Content + Domain | **120** | Should AI engines cite this source? |

### 8 Dimensions

| System | Dim | Full Name | Core Question |
|--------|-----|-----------|---------------|
| CORE | **C** | Contextual Clarity | Does content match intent? Is the answer upfront? |
| CORE | **O** | Organization | Is structure clear? Can AI parse it efficiently? |
| CORE | **R** | Referenceability | Can data and evidence be verified and cited? |
| CORE | **E** | Exclusivity | What unique value does this add? Why cite you over others? |
| EEAT | **Exp** | Experience | Does the creator have first-hand experience? |
| EEAT | **Ept** | Expertise | Does the creator have professional competence? |
| EEAT | **A** | Authority | Do third parties recognize this source? |
| EEAT | **T** | Trust | Is the site technically, legally, and governance-wise trustworthy? |

### Priority Tags

Each check item carries a priority tag indicating its primary optimization target:

| Tag | Meaning | When to Prioritize |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| GEO-First 🎯 | Critical for AI engine citation | Content targeting AI search visibility |
| SEO-First 🔍 | Critical for traditional search ranking | Content targeting Google/Bing organic traffic |
| Dual ⚡ | Important for both channels | All content should aim for these |

# Part 3: Scoring System

## Per-Item Scoring

| Status | Score | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Pass** | 10 | Fully meets criteria |
| **Partial** | 5 | Partially meets criteria |
| **Fail** | 0 | Does not meet criteria |

## Dimension and Total Scores

Each dimension: sum of 10 items = 0–100 points.

```
GEO Score = (C + O + R + E) / 4
SEO Score = (Exp + Ept + A + T) / 4
Total Score = (GEO Score + SEO Score) / 2
```

## Weighted Scoring by Content Type

For specific content types, apply dimension weights instead of equal averaging:

```
Weighted Score = Σ (dimension_score × weight)
```

| Dim | Product Review | How-to Guide | Comparison | Landing Page | Blog Post | FAQ Page | Alternative | Best-of | Testimonial |
|-----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **C** | 10% | 20% | 10% | 20% | 25% | 25% | 10% | 10% | 10% |
| **O** | 10% | 20% | 20% | 10% | 10% | 25% | 15% | 25% | 5% |
| **R** | 15% | 10% | 25% | 5% | 10% | 15% | 25% | 20% | 15% |
| **E** | 20% | 5% | 10% | 5% | 20% | 5% | 5% | 15% | 10% |
| **Exp** | 20% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 10% | 5% | 15% | 5% | 30% |
| **Ept** | 5% | 20% | 15% | 5% | 10% | 10% | 5% | 10% | 5% |
| **A** | 5% | 5% | 5% | 25% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| **T** | 15% | 15% | 10% | 25% | 10% | 10% | 20% | 10% | 20% |

**Example** (Product Review):
```
Score = C×0.10 + O×0.10 + R×0.15 + E×0.20 + Exp×0.20 + Ept×0.05 + A×0.05 + T×0.15
```

## Rating Scale

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 90–100 | Excellent | Industry benchmark quality |
| 75–89 | Good | Outperforms most competitors |
| 60–74 | Medium | Meets baseline with room to improve |
| 40–59 | Low | Needs focused optimization |
| 0–39 | Poor | Needs complete restructuring |

## Veto Items

These items trigger a risk alert regardless of total score:

| Item | Trigger | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| **T04** Disclosure Statements | Affiliate links present without disclosure | Trust dimension = Fail |
| **C01** Intent Alignment | Clickbait; content doesn't match title | Content credibility destroyed |
| **R10** Content Consistency | Core data contradicts itself | Citation reliability = zero |

# Part 4: Content Type Guide

## Decision Tree

```
What is the primary goal?
│
├── Teach users how to do something         → Blog (guides)
├── Your product vs one competitor           → Alternative
├── Objective comparison of 3+ products      → Best-of
├── Show product fits a persona              → Use-case
├── Show verified customer results           → Testimonial
├── Answer common questions                  → FAQ (or embed as faqs[] field)
├── Describe product features                → Landing
└── Share industry insights or trends        → Blog (insights)
```

## Boundary Disambiguation

| Confusion Pair | Type A | Type B | Deciding Factor |
|---------------|--------|--------|----------------|
| 1v1 vs multi-product | Alternative | Best-of | Alternative = persuade to switch; Best-of = help choose |
| User story vs customer proof | Use-case | Testimonial | Use-case = fictional persona; Testimonial = verified customer data |
| FAQ quantity | Embed as `faqs[]` | Dedicated FAQ page | <5 embed; 5–9 either; 10+ dedicated page |
| Product intro vs tutorial | Landing | Blog | Landing = short, feature-focused; Blog = long, educational |

## Citation Tier Requirements

Source tiers: **Tier 1** (.gov/.edu/official docs) | **Tier 2** (industry authorities: Moz, Ahrefs, Forbes) | **Tier 3** (community blogs)

| Content Type | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Notes |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Blog (guides) | 1+ | 0–1 | 0 | Official tool documentation |
| Blog (tools) | 2+ | 1+ | 0–1 | Each tool's pricing page required |
| Blog (insights) | 2+ | 2+ | 0–1 | Research and data sources |
| Alternative | 1+ | 0–1 | 0 | Competitor's official pricing page |
| Best-of | 3+ | 1+ | 0–1 | All tools' pricing pages |
| Use-case | 0–1 | 1+ | 0 | Industry statistics |
| FAQ | 0 | 0 | 0 | User-generated content primarily |
| Testimonial | 0 | 0 | 0 | Verified customer data |
| Landing | 0–1 | 0 | 0 | Own product data |

## Review Frequency

| Content Type | First Review | Regular Review | Re-review Trigger |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Blog | Before publish | Quarterly | Ranking drops, info expires |
| Alternative | Before publish | Monthly | Competitor price/feature changes |
| Best-of | Before publish | Monthly | New tools launch, pricing changes |
| Use-case | Before publish | Quarterly | Industry data updates |
| Testimonial | Before publish | Annually | Customer info changes |
| FAQ | Before publish | Quarterly | New frequent questions appear |
| Landing | Before publish | As needed | Product feature updates |

## Emergency Brake

These conditions require immediate action — do not wait for full evaluation:

| Trigger | Severity | Immediate Action |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| T04 Fail: Affiliate links without disclosure | **Critical** | Add disclosure banner at page top |
| C01 Fail: Clickbait title | **Critical** | Rewrite title and first paragraph |
| R10 Fail: Core data contradicts itself | **High** | Verify all data before publishing |
| 3+ Fails in same dimension | **High** | Systematic restructure of that dimension |

## Content Lifecycle

```

```

**Update vs Archive Decision**:

```
Is the content still accurate?
├── YES → Update lastVerified date, continue monitoring
└── NO → Can it be updated?
    ├── YES (minor fix) → Update content, note revision
    ├── YES (major rewrite) → Full Gate 1-4 process
    └── NO (topic obsolete) → Archive:

## CITE Domain Rating Integration

> How CORE-EEAT content-level items feed into [CITE Domain Rating](../cite-domain-rating/) domain-level scores.

When evaluating holistically, pair CORE-EEAT with CITE:

| CORE-EEAT Items | Feeds Into CITE Item | Relationship |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| C02 (Direct Answer), O02 (Summary Box), E01 (Original Data) | CITE C05-C08 (AI Citations) | Citable content drives domain-level AI citations |
| A07 (Knowledge Graph), A08 (Entity Consistency) | CITE I01 (Knowledge Graph Presence) | Content-level authority signals build domain identity |
| O05 (Schema Markup), R09 (HTML Semantics) | CITE I04 (Schema.org Coverage) | Page-level Schema contributes to domain-wide coverage |
| Ept01 (Author Identity), Ept02 (Credentials) | CITE I05 (Author Entity Recognition) | Content author signals build domain author recognition |
| T03 (Security Standards) | CITE T07 (Technical Security) | Same signal, different scope (page vs domain) |
| C03 (Query Coverage), E08 (Depth Advantage) | CITE E07-E08 (Topical Authority) | Content depth and coverage build domain topical authority |

**Cross-evaluation pattern**:

| Pattern | CITE Score | CORE-EEAT Score | Diagnosis | Action |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Strong domain, strong content | High | High | Ideal state | Maintain and expand |
| Strong domain, weak content | High | Low | Authority wasted on poor content | Prioritize content quality (CORE-EEAT) |
| Weak domain, strong content | Low | High | Great content, invisible domain | Build domain authority (CITE) |
| Weak domain, weak content | Low | Low | Fundamental issues | Start with CORE-EEAT, then CITE |

## Common Errors

| # | Error | Item | Wrong | Right |
|---|-------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Answer buried | C02 | 500-word preamble before answer | Core answer in first 150 words |
| 2 | Clickbait title | C01 | "Shocking! This method is insane" | Title accurately describes content |
| 3 | Heading skip | O01 | H1 jumps to H3, no H2 | H1→H2→H3 sequential nesting |
| 4 | Wall of text | O06 | Single 300-word paragraph | 3–5 sentences per paragraph, by topic |
| 5 | No summary | O02 | No TL;DR or key takeaways | Key Takeaways box at article top |
| 6 | Vague numbers | R01 | "very fast", "very cheap" | "120ms response", "$29/mo" |
| 7 | Unsourced stats | R02 | "Studies show 90% of users..." | Include source link and year |
| 8 | Stale pricing | R06 | 2023 prices shown, no date | "Pricing as of 2026-02" |
| 9 | Broken links | R10 | External links to 404 pages | Regular link audits; fix or remove |
| 10 | No unique value | E01 | Restates official docs verbatim | Add original test data or comparisons |
| 11 | No first person | Exp01 | Entirely third-person tone | Add "I tested" or "We found" |
| 12 | Only positives | Exp06 | Zero negatives; reads like an ad | Honestly share ≥2 downsides |
| 13 | No author info | Ept01 | No byline, avatar, or bio | Name + photo + 30-word bio |
| 14 | Undisclosed affiliate | T04 | Affiliate links without disclosure | Disclosure banner at page top |
| 15 | Missing FAQ Schema | O05 | Q&A content without JSON-LD | Add FAQPage Schema markup |

## MECE Disambiguation Rules

When unsure which dimension a check item belongs to:

| Rule | Assign To |
|------|-----------|
| Visible in the article or page | CORE |
| Requires checking author, org, or site | EEAT |
| "Can this sentence be verified?" | CORE-R |
| "Is this entity worth trusting?" | EEAT-T |
| "Does this content add unique value?" | CORE-E |
| "Does the value come from personal experience?" | EEAT-Exp |

### Commonly Confused Pairs

| Pair | Disambiguation |
|------|---------------|
| **R (Citation Density)** vs **A (Backlinks)** | R = sources YOU cite (outbound); A = others citing YOU (inbound) |
| **CORE-E (Exclusivity)** vs **Exp (Experience)** | E = is the content unique (information gain); Exp = did the creator personally experience it |
| **R (Timestamp)** vs **T (Correction Policy)** | R = is info current (freshness); T = is there a maintenance mechanism (governance) |
| **O (Schema)** vs **R (HTML Semantics)** | O = page-level JSON-LD; R = semantic tags in content (`<article>`, `<time>`) |
| **R (Method Transparency)** vs **Ept (Method Rigor)** | R = was the method documented (transparency); Ept = is the method sound (quality) |
| **Ept (Reasoning)** vs **R (Evidence Mapping)** | Ept = is reasoning explainable; R = does each claim have an evidence chain |
