# h34v3nzc0dex/strix-halo-llm-finetune-guide

Home-enthusiast's guide to fine-tuning 27B+ LLMs on AMD Strix Halo (gfx1151, Ryzen AI MAX+ 395) — the patches and tuning to make Linux mainline + ROCm 7.13 nightly + PyTorch 2.11 + bitsandbytes + flash-linear-attention all work together for multi-day LoRA training with out-of-process eval orchestration.

# Fine-Tuning 27B+ LLMs on AMD Strix Halo — A Home Enthusiast's Guide

A reproducible recipe for fine-tuning Qwen3.5-27B (or larger) hybrid LLMs on a single AMD Strix Halo APU (Ryzen AI MAX+ 395, Radeon 8060S, gfx1151) with 128 GB of unified memory — including the patches, system tuning, and out-of-process evaluation orchestrator that make multi-day training runs survivable on consumer hardware.

> **Status:** Tested on a Corsair AI Workstation 300 (Sixunited AXB35-02 board) running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, mainline kernel 6.19.14 (as tested; 6.19 now EOL — use 7.0.x, see [Upgrade-path gotchas](#upgrade-path-gotchas)), ROCm 7.13 nightly. The same recipe should work on Framework Desktop, GMKtec EVO-X2, FEVM FA-EX9, Bosgame M5 — any AXB35-02 / Strix Halo system.

---

## TL;DR

If you tried to fine-tune a ≥27B model on a Strix Halo box and ran into:

- `Configured ROCm binary not found at libbitsandbytes_rocm83.so`
- Triton kernels asserting on `num_warps > 4`
- Trainer eval OOMing or dying with `page allocation failure: order:0` mid-eval
- Memory-watchdog SIGKILL during eval
- TRL crashing in `create_model_card` with `PackageNotFoundError: trl`
- Linux mainline `.deb` kernels failing to install with `run-parts: missing operand`
- `/srv` perms randomly regressing to `0750` after `apt upgrade`
- **Mid-training eval mysteriously freezes the box** at ~66 % weight load with `/proc/interrupts:TLB:` rate spiking past 1 M/sec — even after every fix above is in place
- **`convert_lora_to_gguf.py` blowing up** on Qwen3.5 LoRA adapters with `NotImplementedError: can't reshape the row size trivially`, blocking any attempt to use `llama-perplexity --lora` as the eval path

…this guide solves every one of those. It's the writeup of about a week of iteration on a real production fine-tune, plus a follow-up week of root-causing the TLB-IPI storm (Step 7) and shipping the storm-free eval path (Step 7b–c). We don't claim novelty on any individual piece — but the *combination* on this hardware isn't documented anywhere else we could find.

---

## Who this is for

You have a Strix Halo / gfx1151 workstation with 128 GB unified memory. You want to fine-tune a 7B–32B parameter LLM (or larger MoE in the 100B class) locally. You're comfortable with Linux, bash, git, Python, and the HuggingFace stack. You don't have a cloud GPU budget. You're willing to patch a few open-source projects and accept multi-day training times.

---

## Prerequisites — install before you begin

Anything not in a stock Ubuntu Server install you'll need:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential cmake ninja-build git curl jq \
    python3-venv python3-dev \
    linux-headers-generic
```

### AMD ROCm 7.1 apt repository

The bnb-from-source build (Step 5) needs `hiprand-dev`, `rocrand-dev`, `hipcub-dev`, `rocprim-dev`, `rocthrust-dev`. The llama.cpp build (Step 6) needs `/opt/rocm-7.1.0/bin/hipcc` and the ROCm clang toolchain. Both come from AMD's apt repository:

```bash
# Add the keyring
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -qO- https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key \
    | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg > /dev/null

# Add the 7.1 repo (Ubuntu 24.04 noble)
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rocm.gpg] https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/7.1 noble main" \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y rocm-hip-runtime rocm-cmake hipcc \
    hiprand-dev rocrand-dev hipcub-dev rocprim-dev rocthrust-dev
```

This leaves ROCm at `/opt/rocm-7.1.0/`. The Python wheels you'll install in Step 3 are a *separate* ROCm 7.13 nightly that lives entirely inside the venv and doesn't conflict with the apt-installed 7.1.

The orchestrator is bash. The training and eval scripts are Python. They never coexist in the same process — that's the whole point. Training holds the GPU until it exits cleanly at a `max_steps` boundary, GPU memory fully releases, then a fresh Python process loads from the just-saved checkpoint and runs eval. This sidesteps the in-process eval failure modes that bite on unified memory APUs.

## Quick start (for the impatient)

```bash
# 0. Install prereqs (build tools + ROCm 7.1 apt repo) — see Prerequisites above

# 1. Install latest stable mainline kernel from kernel.ubuntu.com/mainline/ — 6.19.14 was tested,
#    but 6.19 is EOL (2026-04-22); target 7.0.x (gfx1151 floor 6.18.4). See Step 1 / Upgrade-path gotchas.
# Apply scripts/fix-kernel-run-parts.py to the .debs before installing
# (full repack ritual is in Step 1 below)

# 2. Set up sysctl + THP
sudo cp configs/90-strix-halo-vm-tuning.conf /etc/sysctl.d/
sudo sysctl --system
echo always | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo defer  | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag

# 3. Add /srv perm watchdog (CRITICAL — prevents random crashes mid-train)
sudo cp configs/srv-perms-watch.cron /etc/cron.d/srv-perms-watch

# 4. Add defrag helper + sudoers (substitutes your username automatically)
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 scripts/gpu-defrag-mem /usr/local/bin/gpu-defrag-mem
sed "s/<user>/$(whoami)/" configs/gpu-defrag-mem.sudoers \
    | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/gpu-defrag-mem > /dev/null
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/gpu-defrag-mem
sudo visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/gpu-defrag-mem  # validate

# 5. GRUB — add ttm.* + transparent_hugepage to kernel cmdline
# (see configs/grub-cmdline.example), then sudo update-grub && reboot

# 6. Set up venv + nightly PyTorch
python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
pip install --pre \
  "torch==2.11.0+rocm7.13.0a20260506" \
  "torchvision==0.26.0+rocm7.13.0a20260506" \
  "torchaudio==2.11.0+rocm7.13.0a20260506" \
  "triton==3.6.0+rocm7.13.0a20260506" \
  --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2-staging/gfx1151/ \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/

# 7. Build flash-linear-attention from patched source (see Step 4 below)
# 8. Build bitsandbytes from source for ROCm gfx1151 (see Step 5 below)
# 9. Set up Telegram alerts (optional — see Step 9 below)

# 10. Supply your own training script (see Training script contract below),
#     then run the orchestrator
nohup ./scripts/train_orchestrator.sh \
    --total-steps 448 \
    --output-dir /path/to/your/output \
    --eval-data /path/to/your/eval.jsonl \
    --history /path/to/your/eval_history.jsonl \
    --lora-r 128 --lora-alpha 256 \
    > orchestrator.log 2>&1 &
```

If any of those steps don't make sense, keep reading.

<!-- NOTE: this heading's anchor slug `step-1--kernel-61914-mainline` is linked from the
     Troubleshooting table and the Upgrade-path gotchas section. Update both if you rename it. -->
## Step 1 — Kernel 6.19.14 (mainline)

Recent gfx1151 KFD driver fixes are in mainline kernels only. Distros lag. Use Ubuntu's mainline build.

> **6.19.14 is the version we originally tested on, but the 6.19 series reached EOL 2026-04-22.** It still runs fine, but for a fresh install target the latest stable mainline (7.0.x) — the floor for gfx1151 is mainline ≥ 6.18.4 / Ubuntu 24.04 HWE 6.17. The install steps below are identical for any version; just swap the `v6.19.14` in the URLs. See [Upgrade-path gotchas](#upgrade-path-gotchas).

### Install

Download the four `.deb` files from `https://kernel.ubuntu.com/mainline/v6.19.14/amd64/`:

```
linux-headers-6.19.14-061914_*_all.deb
linux-headers-6.19.14-061914-generic_*_amd64.deb
linux-image-unsigned-6.19.14-061914-generic_*_amd64.deb
linux-modules-6.19.14-061914-generic_*_amd64.deb
```

### Fix the `run-parts` bug (CRITICAL)

Mainline kernel `.deb`s have a **double-dir `run-parts` bug** that breaks `dpkg -i` on Ubuntu 24.04+. The maintainer scripts call:

```bash
run-parts --report --exit-on-error --arg=$version \
    --arg=$image_path /etc/kernel/postinst.d /usr/share/kernel/postinst.d
```

`run-parts` only accepts ONE directory. Multi-dir form errors out, dpkg leaves the package half-configured. The fix script in this repo (`scripts/fix-kernel-run-parts.py`) rewrites these to:

```bash
if [ -d /etc/kernel/postinst.d ]; then
    run-parts ... /etc/kernel/postinst.d
fi
if [ -d /usr/share/kernel/postinst.d ]; then
    run-parts ... /usr/share/kernel/postinst.d
fi
```

The `if/fi` form (NOT `&&`) matters — using `[ -d ] && cmd` propagates exit-1 from a missing `/usr/share/kernel/X.d` out of the heredoc-generated trigger script and half-configures the package anyway.

```bash
# Repack the affected .debs:
mkdir -p extracted
for f in linux-image*.deb linux-modules*.deb linux-headers-*-generic_*amd64.deb; do
    name=$(basename "$f" .deb)
    mkdir -p "extracted/$name"
    dpkg-deb -R "$f" "extracted/$name"
done
python3 scripts/fix-kernel-run-parts.py \
    extracted/linux-image*/DEBIAN/{preinst,postinst,prerm,postrm} \
    extracted/linux-modules*/DEBIAN/postinst \
    extracted/linux-headers-*-generic_*/DEBIAN/postinst
for d in extracted/*; do dpkg-deb --build "$d" "$(basename "$d")-fixed.deb"; done

# Install:
sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-*-all.deb *-fixed.deb
sudo update-grub && sudo reboot
```

### Boot params

After reboot, edit `/etc/default/grub`:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash iommu=pt pcie_aspm.policy=performance amdgpu.runpm=0 ttm.pages_limit=33554432 ttm.page_pool_size=33554432 transparent_hugepage=always numa_balancing=disable"
```

Then `sudo update-grub && sudo reboot`.

**Note:** `transparent_hugepage=always` doesn't always stick on Ubuntu — something in early boot resets it to `madvise`. Persist it via `/etc/rc.local` — the `tee -a` command is in [Step 2 → Transparent huge pages](#step-2--system-tuning). Do it once (don't append the same lines in both steps).

### Verify

```bash
uname -r                                              # 6.19.14-061914-generic
cat /proc/cmdline | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -E "ttm|hugepage"
sudo dmesg | grep "GTT memory ready"                  # should show 131072M
ls /sys/class/drm/card0/device/mem_info_vram_used     # must exist
```

---

## Step 2 — System tuning

Per AMD's MI300A optimization guide (the only AMD-blessed unified-memory APU tuning doc), **proactive page compaction is mandatory** for unified-memory APUs. Without it, the GPU's TTM allocator hits page-allocation failures during heavy bursts (mid-training eval, model load) even when 90% of system RAM is free, because the page allocator's free-list is fragmented.

> **About the `configs/` directory:** every file under `configs/` is **provided by this repo** — none of them exist on a fresh Ubuntu install. You're adding them. Read each one before copying it into place; they're short and well-commented. The `<user>` placeholder in the sudoers file must be replaced with your actual username before install (the section below shows how).

### sysctl — `90-strix-halo-vm-tuning.conf`

This file goes into `/etc/sysctl.d/` as a *new drop-in*. Linux's sysctl loader processes everything in `/etc/sysctl.d/` in lexical order at boot and on `sysctl --system`. The `90-` prefix means "load near the end so I override earlier defaults" — your existing `/etc/sysctl.conf` and other drop-ins aren't touched.

```bash
sudo cp configs/90-strix-halo-vm-tuning.conf /etc/sysctl.d/
sudo sysctl --system
sysctl vm.compaction_proactiveness   # should print 20
```

The two key settings (the file has more — open it and read the comments):

```
vm.compaction_proactiveness = 20
vm.compact_unevictable_allowed = 1
```

### Transparent huge pages

THP=always doesn't always stick from the GRUB cmdline (Ubuntu 24.04+ has something in early boot that resets it to `madvise`). Set live AND add to `/etc/rc.local` for persistence:

```bash
echo always | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo defer  | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag

# Persist across reboots:
sudo tee -a /etc/rc.local > /dev/null <<'EOF'
echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo defer  > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
EOF
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```

### Defrag helper — `gpu-defrag-mem` + sudoers

`scripts/gpu-defrag-mem` is a tiny shell script that runs `compact_memory + drop_caches`. The training orchestrator calls it before each eval (and you can invoke it manually any time) to give the GPU's TTM allocator contiguous free pages on a unified-memory pool.

The sudoers drop-in lets your training user run `gpu-defrag-mem` with `sudo -n` (no password). **Replace `<user>` with your actual Linux username** before installing:

```bash
# Install the script — explicit root:root + 0755 so the NOPASSWD sudoers
# entry below isn't a privesc vector if the binary were ever writable
# by anyone but root.
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 scripts/gpu-defrag-mem /usr/local/bin/gpu-defrag-mem

# Edit the sudoers file: replace <user> with your actual username
# (whatever `whoami` returns)
sed "s/<user>/$(whoami)/" configs/gpu-defrag-mem.sudoers \
    | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/gpu-defrag-mem > /dev/null
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/gpu-defrag-mem
sudo visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/gpu-defrag-mem  # validate

# Test (should run without prompting for password):
sudo -n /usr/local/bin/gpu-defrag-mem && echo OK
```

If `visudo -c` reports a syntax error, the placeholder substitution failed — re-check the username doesn't contain shell-special characters.

> **Why `install -o root -g root -m 0755`?** A NOPASSWD sudoers rule that points at a script which isn't strictly root-owned and 0755 (or stricter) becomes a trivial privilege-escalation path: anyone with write access to that binary can edit it to do anything. `install` sets ownership and mode atomically. `cp` + `chmod` would leave the file world-writable for a fraction of a second.

### `/srv` perm watchdog — `srv-perms-watch.cron` (this one bit us hard)

Some apt postinst scripts (we suspect systemd / dpkg / snapd updates) silently chmod `/srv` to `0750`, which breaks every non-root process needing to traverse to anything under `/srv/*`. We hit this **mid-segment** during a 9-hour training run — the trainer crashed in `create_model_card → importlib.metadata.version("trl")` because the metadata path lookup couldn't traverse `/srv`. We lost the entire segment.

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0644 configs/srv-perms-watch.cron /etc/cron.d/srv-perms-watch
# The cron now restores /srv to 755 every minute. Idempotent.
```

You won't hit this on every system, and it's not specific to fine-tuning — it's a defensive fix for an apt postinst regression. If you're storing your venv, training output, or any long-running process state under `/srv/`, install this. It's three bytes of cron and saves you from a 9-hour-loss class of bug.

> **Skip this if** you have a separate reason to keep `/srv` mode 0750 (e.g. it holds something you've intentionally hardened). The watchdog will silently weaken that hardening every minute.

## Step 3 — PyTorch nightly + ROCm

The wheels live at AMD's gfx1151 nightly index. They're date-stamped — pick a date that has *all four* of `torch`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio`, `triton` available with matching versions. Wheels older than ~30 days are typically GC'd.

Find a current date that works:

```bash
# Get the most recent torch nightly date that exists for both torch + triton:
curl -s https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2-staging/gfx1151/torch/ \
    | grep -oE '2.11.0\+rocm7.13.0a[0-9]{8}' | sort -u | tail -5
# Pick a date (e.g. the most recent) and substitute below.
```

Then install pinned to that date (substitute `DATE` everywhere):

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate

DATE=20260506   # ← replace with a date from the previous command
pip install --pre \
  "torch==2.11.0+rocm7.13.0a${DATE}" \
  "torchvision==0.26.0+rocm7.13.0a${DATE}" \
  "torchaudio==2.11.0+rocm7.13.0a${DATE}" \
  "triton==3.6.0+rocm7.13.0a${DATE}" \
  "rocm==7.13.0a${DATE}" \
  "rocm-sdk-core==7.13.0a${DATE}" \
  "rocm-sdk-libraries-gfx1151==7.13.0a${DATE}" \
  --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2-staging/gfx1151/ \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/
# rocm / rocm-sdk-* are pulled in transitively by torch; they're pinned above only
# for reproducible dates. The quick-start's torch-only install gets them too.

# Verify
TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 python -c "
import torch
print('torch:', torch.__version__)
print('hip:', torch.version.hip)
print('arch:', torch.cuda.get_arch_list())
x = torch.randn(2048, 2048, device='cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16)
y = x @ x.T
torch.cuda.synchronize()
print('bf16 matmul OK')
"
```

Two non-obvious points:

1. **`TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` MUST be set before `import torch`.** AOTriton on gfx1151 is gated behind this flag. Without it the fused SDPA kernel is unavailable and attention falls back to the eager/math decomposition — dramatically slower.
2. **Don't set `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`.** It's a habit from earlier ROCm 6 setups and it actively *breaks* native gfx1151 kernels. If your `~/.bashrc` has it, remove it.

---

## Step 4 — flash-linear-attention (patched source)

Hybrid models with linear-attention layers (Qwen3.5, Mamba-3, GatedDeltaNet variants) need FLA's Triton kernels. The PyPI wheel works on H100 but **crashes on gfx1151** for two reasons:

1. **`num_warps > 4` triggers Triton `LinearLayoutConversions` assertion failures on RDNA 3 / 3.5** (observed firsthand on gfx1151). Same assertion class as the upstream H100 report at `num_warps=8` ([triton#5609](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/5609)) — different hardware, lower warp threshold on RDNA.
2. **`tl.cumsum + tl.sum` interaction has a codegen bug** that hits gfx1151 (and apparently also H100 in some configs). [triton#3017](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/3017).

> **On the current nightly stack, vanilla FLA also works.** The `num_warps`-cap and `cumsum.py` patches below were only needed on the older Triton 3.4 / ROCm 7.1 stack — on Triton 3.6 / ROCm 7.13 nightly, vanilla PyPI FLA 0.5.0 runs at production scale without them, so `pip install flash-linear-attention` is enough for a working setup. We keep the patched editable build for continuity (a multi-day run shouldn't be validated against a moving wheel); the patched recipe follows. See [Upgrade-path gotchas](#upgrade-path-gotchas).

The fix:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention /path/to/fla-patched
cd /path/to/fla-patched

# Apply num_warps + cumsum patches via the script in this repo.
# The --cumsum-backup arg points at scripts/cumsum-pytorch.py which we ship
# (it's a verbatim copy of the patched cumsum.py from a working install).
GUIDE=/path/to/strix-halo-llm-finetune-guide
python3 $GUIDE/scripts/fla_repatch.py \
    --fla-root /path/to/fla-patched \
    --cumsum-backup $GUIDE/scripts/cumsum-pytorch.py

# Clear stale autotune cache (Triton caches kernels under ~/.triton/cache;
# patched FLA produces different kernel shapes so old caches are invalid)
rm -rf ~/.triton/cache
find . -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} +

# Install editable
pip install -e .
```

Re-run `fla_repatch.py` after every `git pull` of FLA. It's idempotent — running it on already-patched code is a no-op.

---

## Step 5 — bitsandbytes from source for ROCm

**The PyPI bnb wheel ships zero ROCm binaries.** It only has CPU + CUDA `.so` files. If you try `optim="paged_adamw_8bit"` you'll get:

```
RuntimeError: Configured ROCm binary not found at libbitsandbytes_rocm83.so
```

Build from source:

```bash
# Required apt packages
sudo apt install -y hiprand-dev rocrand-dev hipcub-dev rocprim-dev rocthrust-dev

# Clone
git clone https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes /path/to/bnb-rocm
cd /path/to/bnb-rocm

# Configure with ROCm 7.1.0 toolchain + gcc-13 for clang's libstdc++ lookup
PATH=/opt/rocm-7.1.0/bin:$PATH \
cmake -G Ninja \
  -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=hip \
  -DBNB_ROCM_ARCH="gfx1151" \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DROCM_VERSION=83 \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_FLAGS="--gcc-install-dir=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/13" \
  -S . -B build

# Build
PATH=/opt/rocm-7.1.0/bin:$PATH cmake --build build --config Release

# Symlink: bnb's runtime version detection expects libbitsandbytes_rocm713.so
# on PyTorch 2.10/2.11 + HIP 7.13, but the build produced rocm83.so.
# Absolute paths so this works regardless of caller's current directory.
ln -sf /path/to/bnb-rocm/bitsandbytes/libbitsandbytes_rocm83.so \
       /path/to/bnb-rocm/bitsandbytes/libbitsandbytes_rocm713.so

# Install editable (replaces PyPI bnb)
pip uninstall -y bitsandbytes
pip install -e .
```

### CRITICAL gotcha — the namespace package shadow

If a previous setup left `/path/to/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/bitsandbytes/libbitsandbytes_rocm82.so` lying around (a symlink to a non-existent file from an older bnb install), Python treats that directory as a **namespace package** — and silently shadows your editable install. Symptom: `import bitsandbytes; print(bitsandbytes.__file__)` returns `None`, no `.optim` attribute. Cure:

```bash
rm -rf /path/to/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/bitsandbytes
# Then re-test:
python -c "import bitsandbytes; print(bitsandbytes.__file__)"
# Should resolve to /path/to/bnb-rocm/bitsandbytes/__init__.py
```

### Verify

```python
import torch
import bitsandbytes
assert bitsandbytes.__file__ is not None
from bitsandbytes.optim import PagedAdamW8bit
p = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(64, 64, device='cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16, requires_grad=True))
opt = PagedAdamW8bit([p], lr=1e-4)
(p*p).sum().backward()
opt.step()
torch.cuda.synchronize()
print("PagedAdamW8bit step succeeded")
```

---

## Step 6 — llama.cpp HIP build (for inference)

If you want to run the resulting fine-tune via `llama-server`, build llama.cpp with the `--gcc-install-dir` flag (without it, ROCm 7.1.0's clang-20 can't find `<cmath>`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp /path/to/llama.cpp
cd /path/to/llama.cpp
PATH=/opt/rocm-7.1.0/bin:$PATH \
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DGGML_HIP=ON \
  -DGGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=OFF \
  -DGGML_HIP_GRAPHS=ON \
  -DGGML_HIP_MMQ_MFMA=ON \
  -DGGML_HIP_NO_VMM=ON \
  -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1151 \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_FLAGS="--gcc-install-dir=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/13"
PATH=/opt/rocm-7.1.0/bin:$PATH cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
```

Then symlink the binaries to where §6b and the eval harness expect them — `RUNPATH` is baked to `build/bin` (see the move warning below), so a symlink is safe; the binary still resolves its `.so`s from the real build dir:

```bash
sudo ln -sf "$PWD/build/bin/llama-server"     /usr/local/bin/llama-server
sudo ln -sf "$PWD/build/bin/llama-perplexity" /usr/local/bin/llama-perplexity
```

`GGML_HIP_GRAPHS=ON` is now upstream default (b867+) but explicitly enabling doesn't hurt.

**`GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=OFF` is intentional** despite being the AMD-recommended setting for RDNA 3.5. On gfx1151 specifically, the rocwmma flash-attention path is dramatically slower than llama.cpp's runtime FA at any non-trivial context depth — about **2.4× slower on prefill at 8k context** on both dense Qwen3.5-27B and MoE Qwen3.6-A3B. TG is unaffected (memory-bandwidth-bound). Hardware-verified A/B with numbers + reproduction scripts in [`rocwmma-fattn-sweep/`](rocwmma-fattn-sweep/). Earlier versions of this guide recommended `ON`; that was wrong and is now corrected.

**Minimum build for `--spec-type draft-mtp` GPU dispatch: b9180+** (community-reported — see the u/kant12 credit in §6b; our own b1270 attempt also used `llama-cli`, so it doesn't independently bisect the floor). Older builds (we tried b1270 via lemonade's prebuilt) will accept the `--spec-type draft-mtp` flag without complaint but never dispatch the draft model to the GPU — the process pegs a CPU core at 0% GPU and never makes progress. Symptom is silent. **And use `llama-server`, not `llama-cli`** for the speculation path; we burned hours on this and the `llama-cli` path doesn't wire the draft dispatcher the same way. Settings shown in §6b below.

**Build in the directory you intend to keep it in.** cmake bakes the absolute `build/bin` path into the binary's `RUNPATH`, so if you build in `/tmp/llama.cpp-test/` and then move the tree to `/srv/aurora-ai/llama.cpp/`, the resulting binary will fail to find its shared libraries (`libllama-server-impl.so` etc.) on launch. Reconfigure + rebuild in the final location, or use `patchelf --set-rpath`. We hit this swapping our own production build from a staging dir.

---

## Step 6b — Inference settings for Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6

If you're serving the fine-tune (or any Qwen3.5/3.6 base model) via `llama-server` for chat or tool-call use, a few runtime settings beyond the build flags matter on this hardware. These are what we run in production:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/llama-server-qwen35.service (excerpt)
[Service]
# Overlay the nightly torch-wheel libhsa over apt ROCm 7.1.0 — stock 7.1.0's
# libhsa-runtime64.so has a null-ptr bug on gfx1151. Point at your venv's
# _rocm_sdk_core/lib (same overlay rocwmma-fattn-sweep/bench.sh + the eval
# harness use). Adjust python3.X to your venv.
Environment=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/_rocm_sdk_core/lib:/opt/rocm/lib
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/llama-server \
    -m /path/to/your-qwen35.gguf \
    -ngl 999 \
    -c 32768 \
    --fit off \
    --no-mmap \
    --reasoning-budget 0 \
    --temp 1.0 \
    --top-p 0.95 \
    --top-k 20 \
    --min-p 0.00 \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8080
```

Per-flag rationale:

- **`--no-mmap`** is the gfx1151 gotcha — mmap-only loading triggers a ~30 min GPU page-table setup wall on the unified-memory path. Either `--no-mmap` *or* `--mmap --direct-io` together work; mmap alone hangs. Documented across multiple Strix Halo issues; not specific to llama.cpp.
- **`--fit off`** disables llama-server's auto-fit; we keep it off across the board (with explicit `-ngl`/`-c`, the sizing heuristic is unnecessary).
- **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` overlay (the `Environment=` line above)** — stock ROCm 7.1.0's `libhsa-runtime64.so` has a null-pointer bug on gfx1151 that surfaces as crashes/hangs at model load. Prepend the nightly runtime from PyTorch's `_rocm_sdk_core` wheel so it wins resolution. Same overlay the repo's benchmark (`rocwmma-fattn-sweep/bench.sh`) and eval harness (`scripts/eval_via_llama_perplexity.py`) rely on; the §6b numbers below were measured with it.
- **`--reasoning-budget 0`** disables the thinking block. **Strongly recommended** for tool-call workflows — Qwen3.5/3.6's native chat template emits tool calls inside the `<thinking>` block, and if the reasoning budget runs out mid-call the response stream looks empty to the client. Leave thinking on only for pure-chat-no-tools workloads where reasoning visibly helps.
- **Sampling: `--temp 1.0 --top-p 0.95 --top-k 20 --min-p 0.00`** is the unsloth-recommended set for Qwen3.5/3.6 with reasoning off. Their per-model sampling guidance is worth following — meaningfully better than llama.cpp's defaults for coherence on this family. See unsloth's [Qwen3.6 docs](https://docs.unsloth.ai/models/qwen3.6) for the per-mode (reasoning vs non-reasoning) recommendations.
- **KV cache quantization (`--cache-type-k q4_0 --cache-type-v q4_0`)** is reported to give measurable memory-bandwidth gains at long context with minimal quality loss on Qwen3.5/3.6. We haven't benched it ourselves yet on this hardware (production is at the F16 cache default, 8k context where the bandwidth pressure is lower) — adding when we do. If you're running long-context (32k+) chat workloads, it's worth trying.

For tool-call agents specifically (Continue, Codex CLI, Roo, OpenClaw, aichat, etc.), also note:

- **Custom Jinja template required for Qwen3-Coder-Next.** The native template emits XML `<tool_call><function=...>...</function></tool_call>` which trips clients expecting Hermes-style JSON `{"name": ..., "arguments": ...}`. Swap via `--chat-template-file <your-hermes.jinja>`. Templates for Qwen3-Coder-Next + Nemotron-3-Super in Hermes format are floating around HuggingFace and the ggml-org/llama.cpp issue tracker.
- **Disable thinking for tool workflows specifically.** Even on models where you want thinking for chat, route tool-call/agent workflows to a separate `llama-server` instance (or a separate role binding in your client config) with `--reasoning-budget 0`.

### Speculative decoding with Qwen3.6-MTP (~1.6× decode speedup on gfx1151)

The Qwen3.6-MTP family bakes Multi-Token Prediction draft heads directly into the GGUF, so you don't need a separate draft model file — `--spec-type draft-mtp` will create the draft context against the target model. On gfx1151 with `llama.cpp ≥ b9180`, served via `llama-server` (the wiring on `llama-cli` is broken), the following stack works cleanly:

```
--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3 \
--spec-type ngram-map-k4v --spec-ngram-map-k4v-size-n 16 --spec-ngram-map-k4v-size-m 24 --spec-ngram-map-k4v-min-hits 2
```

`--spec-type` is stackable in recent builds — the line above stacks MTP draft prediction with an ngram-map-k4v lookup table. Both run alongside each other.

On startup the server logs will confirm GPU dispatch — look for:

```
creating MTP draft context against the target model
common_speculative_impl_draft_mtp: gpu_layers=-1, backend_sampling=1
```

If `gpu_layers` is 0 or unset, you're back on the CPU-pegging path; check your build is `b9180+` and you're invoking via `llama-server`, not `llama-cli`.

Measured on this box (Radeon 8060S / gfx1151 / ROCm 7.1.0 + nightly HSA overlay, Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-Q4_K_M, default sampling):

| Prompt | n_predict | tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| short coding task | 256 | 20.33 |
| short technical | 256 | 19.06 |
| haiku | 128 | 19.13 |
| 500-word essay | 512 | 16.69 |

Mean ~19 tok/s vs ~12 tok/s baseline without spec (the qwen36-bench `tg64` raw number) = **~1.58× speedup**. Credit to [u/kant12](https://reddit.com/user/kant12) for the spec-stack config and the b9180+ build floor.

One harmless warning shows up at model load: `device 'ROCm0' does not have support for op TOP_K needed for sampler 'top-k'`. The top-k sampler falls back to CPU — no measurable throughput hit.

---

## Training script — the contract

This repo intentionally does **not** ship a training script — the one we used is domain-specific (Christmas-light-show effect tool-use) and shipping it would be misleading. Instead, here's the contract `train_orchestrator.sh` expects from whatever script you put at `scripts/train_qwen3_32b.py` (or rename the orchestrator's `TRAIN_SCRIPT_NAME` variable to point at yours).

**Required CLI flags** (orchestrator passes them; your script must accept them):

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--bf16-lora` | Train with bf16 weights + LoRA adapters (no quantization). For QLoRA NF4, just ignore the flag in your script. |
| `--no-eval` | Disable in-process Trainer eval (orchestrator does it out-of-process) |
| `--output-dir DIR` | Where to write `checkpoint-N/` directories. Pass through to `SFTConfig.output_dir`. |
| `--lora-r N` | LoRA rank — pass to `LoraConfig(r=N, ...)` |
| `--lora-alpha N` | LoRA alpha — pass to `LoraConfig(lora_alpha=N, ...)` |
| `--epochs N` | Pass to `SFTConfig.num_train_epochs`. Used only as a fallback when `--max-steps` is 0. |
| `--grad-accum N` | Pass to `SFTConfig.gradient_accumulation_steps` |
| `--max-steps N` | **Critical for the orchestrator.** When > 0, must override `num_train_epochs` and pass to `SFTConfig.max_steps`. The orchestrator increments this between segments to align cleanly to `save_steps` boundaries. |
| `--resume` | When set, call `trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=True)` so the latest `checkpoint-N` in `--output-dir` is loaded. |

**Required behaviour:**

- Use `save_steps=50` (or any value, but pass the same number to the orchestrator's `--save-steps`). The orchestrator's segment alignment math depends on this matching.
- Save checkpoints under `--output-dir/checkpoint-N` where N is the global training step. (HuggingFace `Trainer` does this by default.)
- On clean exit at `max_steps`, return exit code 0. The orchestrator interprets non-zero as a real failure and fires the failure Telegram alert.

**Patterns from our script worth adopting** (these aren't required by the orchestrator but help with the same hardware):

- `os.environ["TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL"] = "1"` **before** `import torch`
- `os.environ["PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF"] = "expandable_segments:True,garbage_collection_threshold:0.6"`
- `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(0.80)` to cap GPU at 102 GB and leave room for the OS on the unified pool
- For Qwen3.5 hybrid (GatedDeltaNet): `attn_implementation="eager"` — SDPA crashes on this architecture
- A "lazy shard loader" patch to `transformers.modeling_utils.safe_open` so the 27B model loads one shard at a time rather than mmap'ing all 17 simultaneously (otherwise you exhaust the unified pool during load)
- `optim="paged_adamw_8bit"` (requires the bnb-from-source build from Step 5)

A minimal working example (just the contract above, no project-specific glue) is in `examples/training_script_skeleton.py`. Note the orchestrator does **not** pass `--base-model` or `--train-data` — your training script supplies those itself (the skeleton defaults them; set the `TRAIN_DATA` env var or edit the defaults).

---

## Step 7 — The eval problem

In-process Trainer eval **does not work** at 27B + 8192 seq length on Strix Halo. We have **four** documented failure modes from real runs:

1. **`page allocation failure: order:0`** in `ttm_pool_alloc_page`. The unified-memory page allocator's free-list is fragmented — the GPU can't get a single contiguous 4 KB page despite 90%+ system RAM free. Killed by amdgpu kernel module.
2. **`memory-watchdog SIGKILL`** when eval pushes free RAM under the watchdog threshold (8 GB on our box). The eager attention scores are ~6.4 GB per layer (24 heads × 8192² float32); with the forward, softmax, and backward buffers across the attention layers live at once it runs to ~25 GB on top of the ~60 GB training state — eval's transient allocations spike fast (~23 seconds into the eval batches) and trip the watchdog.
3. **`importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError: trl`** in TRL's `_save_checkpoint → create_model_card`. This one was caused by `/srv` perms regressing mid-segment, breaking the venv's metadata path traversal.
4. **System hang / near-freeze at ~66 % weight-load**, with `/proc/interrupts:TLB:` rate climbing past 1 M/sec. The box becomes unresponsive long enough that `journald` stops flushing; the only recovery is a hard reset. This is the most subtle failure of the four because the trainer doesn't crash — the *kernel* does.

The system-tuning stack from §2 fixes (1) and (3) — but **(2) is structural**: eval and training simply cannot coexist in the same process at 128 GB unified memory + 27B models. The solution is to **move eval out-of-process** — covered by `eval_checkpoint.py` and the orchestrator in §8.

**(4) is also structural, and turned out to be much deeper than we initially thought.** The HF Transformers weight-load path mmaps each safetensors shard into the page cache. With a 27 B-class bf16 model that's ~54 GB of file-backed pages on top of the eval process's transient anon allocations. The kernel's `mm/vmscan.c` reclaim path walks the LRU, calls `try_to_unmap_one()`, which batches into `try_to_unmap_flush_dirty()` and ultimately fires `arch_tlbbatch_flush()`. On AMD Strix Halo (Zen 5 mobile) the CPUID flag `INVLPGB` is **not exposed**, so the kernel can't use the broadcast-asid fast path — every batched flush fans out as a per-CPU IPI to every CPU in the process's `mm_cpumask`. With Python's 32-thread default, that's 32 IPIs per batched flush. Reclaim does thousands per second under load. ⇒ Storm.

We chased this through three wrong subsystems before pinning it. The full trace methodology (`ftrace` function_graph + `kprobe tlb:tlb_flush` with stacktraces) and the 99.05 %-of-shootdowns-are-`vmscan` finding live in commits/branches of the source project this guide was extracted from — but the actionable parts are below:

- **The kernel patch we *thought* would fix it doesn't.** The original hypothesis was that `amdgpu`'s `svm_range_restore_work` was the source; coalescing it with `AMDGPU_SVM_RANGE_RESTORE_DELAY_MS=100` cut the storm in half but didn't eliminate it. Tracing later showed `amdgpu` accounts for **<0.01 %** of the IPI shootdowns. Don't patch the kernel for this.
- **Userspace mitigations alone don't work either.** We tried `drop_caches` + `vm.swappiness=0`, `mlockall(MCL_FUTURE)` early in the process, pre-mlocking the safetensors source pages — every test either left the storm intact OR removed the kernel's reclaim safety valve and let global OOM-killer fire. The trade-off cliff is documented in the source project. **There is no userspace knob that simultaneously avoids the storm AND fits in 128 GiB on this hardware.**
- **The fix is to stop using HF Transformers for eval entirely.** Skip to §7b.

---

## Step 7b — Storm-free eval via `llama-perplexity`

The pivot: load weights through `llama.cpp` (mmap + selective `--mlock`) instead of HF Transformers (mmap → pagecache pressure → reclaim storm). `llama-perplexity` supports `--lora <adapter.gguf>` so we can keep LoRA training in HF land and only switch the *eval* path.

Measured deltas on identical workload (eval-on-5 against a 27 B-class checkpoint):

|                          | HF Transformers (Step 7 path) | `llama-perplexity` (Step 7b path) |
| ---                      | ---                           | ---                               |
| Peak TLB IPI rate        | ~1.2 M / sec                  | ~110 / sec                        |
| Avg TLB IPI rate         | ~340 k / sec                  | ~110 / sec (no storm)             |
| Total IPIs over the run  | ~48 M in 141 s before freeze  | ~48 k in 436 s                    |
| Reduction                | —                             | **~3 100×**                       |
| eval_metrics.json produced? | No (stall / freeze)        | Yes                               |

`scripts/eval_via_llama_perplexity.py` is a drop-in replacement for `eval_checkpoint.py` from the orchestrator's perspective — same `--adapter / --eval-data / --history / --max-samples` contract, same history JSONL schema.

**Quickstart:**

```bash
# Eval a merged-model GGUF (no LoRA)
python3 scripts/eval_via_llama_perplexity.py \
    --gguf /path/to/qwen3.5-27b-q8_0.gguf \
    --eval-data /path/to/eval.jsonl \
    --metrics-out /tmp/eval_metrics.json

# Eval a base GGUF + LoRA adapter at runtime
# (auto-converts safetensors→GGUF on first use, cached at <adapter>/gguf/lora-f16.gguf)
python3 scripts/eval_via_llama_perplexity.py \
    --gguf /path/to/qwen3.5-27b-q8_0.gguf \
    --adapter /path/to/output/checkpoint-200 \
    --eval-data /path/to/eval.jsonl \
    --history /path/to/eval_history.jsonl
```

The harness:

1. Loads the HF tokenizer (~50 MB — storm-free).
2. Templates up to `--max-samples` JSONL records via `apply_chat_template`.
3. If `--adapter` is given without `--lora`, converts the adapter to GGUF via the patched `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` (see §7c) and caches at `<adapter>/gguf/lora-f16.gguf` (~1.9 GiB f16 for r=128, α=256, ~8 s once).
4. Runs `llama-perplexity -m <base> --mlock -ngl 999 [--lora <adapter.gguf>] -c 8192 -f <tmp.txt> --no-warmup`.
5. Parses `Final estimate: PPL = X` from stdout, computes `eval_loss = ln(PPL)`, writes the per-checkpoint `eval_metrics.json` and (optionally) appends to the orchestrator's history JSONL.

**`eval_token_accuracy` is `null`** in the llama path — `llama-perplexity` doesn't compute argmax token-accuracy. For trend tracking that doesn't matter (relative eval_loss across checkpoints is the actual signal); for absolute comparison against historical HF-eval numbers it does — those numbers won't line up exactly because llama-perplexity scores the *entire* conversation including system/user turns where HF masked them. The trajectory shape is preserved, the absolute floor isn't.

---

## Step 7c — Patching `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` for Qwen3.5

`llama.cpp`'s LoRA converter doesn't support Qwen3.5's GQA V-head reorder for LoRA tensors. First attempt crashes with:

```
File "convert_hf_to_gguf.py", line 5354, in _reorder_v_heads
    tensor = tensor.reshape(*new_shape)
File "convert_lora_to_gguf.py", line 154, in reshape
    raise NotImplementedError  # can't reshape the row size trivially
```

The full diagnosis: the Qwen3.5 model class calls `_LinearAttentionVReorderBase._reorder_v_heads(dim=1, ...)` on the SSM `out_proj` LoRA tensor. `LazyTensor`'s shape primitive encodes only `(*B.shape[:-1], A.shape[-1])` — one in-dim. The reorder needs to grow that into 4D (`out, num_k_heads, num_v_per_k, head_v_dim`) and the wrapper can't represent it.

**Fix:** apply [`patches/convert_lora_to_gguf-qwen35-vhead-reorder.patch`](patches/convert_lora_to_gguf-qwen35-vhead-reorder.patch). It overrides `_reorder_v_heads` on the dynamic `LoraModel` class and applies the equivalent column-permutation directly via `tensor.index_select(...)` on `lora_A` or `lora_B`. Bypasses the LazyTensor limitation entirely. Numerically equivalent to the parent's reshape→permute→reshape (verification snippet in `patches/README.md`).

**Apply:**

```bash
cd /path/to/llama.cpp
patch -p1 < /path/to/this/repo/patches/convert_lora_to_gguf-qwen35-vhead-reorder.patch
```

**Then convert any checkpoint:**

```bash
cd /path/to/llama.cpp
python3 convert_lora_to_gguf.py /path/to/output/checkpoint-N \
    --outfile /path/to/output/checkpoint-N/gguf/lora-f16.gguf \
    --outtype f16
```

`scripts/eval_via_llama_perplexity.py` does this automatically the first time it sees a checkpoint without a cached GGUF — no manual step needed if you use the harness.

This patch is worth upstreaming to `ggml-org/llama.cpp`. If you submit a PR, the verification snippet in `patches/README.md` should travel with the change so reviewers can confirm numerical equivalence.

---

## Step 8 — The orchestrator

`scripts/train_orchestrator.sh` drives training as a sequence of segments aligned to `save_steps=50` boundaries. After each segment:

1. Trainer reaches `max_steps` cleanly, writes checkpoint, exits → process dies → GPU memory fully releases.
2. `wait_gpu_release()` confirms `pgrep` empty + VRAM-used < 5 GB + runs the defrag helper.
3. Eval spawns as a **fresh process**, loads base model + adapter from the just-saved checkpoint, runs eval over a 50-sample subset, appends one line to `eval_history.jsonl`. The eval invocation is governed by the **`EVAL_METHOD`** env var:
   - `EVAL_METHOD=llama` (recommended on Strix Halo) — uses `scripts/eval_via_llama_perplexity.py` (§7b). Storm-free. Auto-converts each checkpoint's LoRA to GGUF on first eval (cached at `<checkpoint>/gguf/lora-f16.gguf`). **Needs the base-model GGUF** — set it via the `BASE_GGUF` env var or `--base-gguf` (the orchestrator passes it to the eval as `--gguf`). It defaults to a placeholder path, so eval fails at every segment boundary until you set it.
   - `EVAL_METHOD=hf` (legacy) — uses `scripts/eval_checkpoint.py`. Will trigger the §7 storm on Strix Halo. Kept only for rollback / diff testing on different hardware.
4. Orchestrator parses last 2 history entries, computes Δ, sends Telegram with success/comparison or warning.
5. Loop until total_steps reached.

**Resume-safe.** Killing the orchestrator and restarting picks up from the latest checkpoint and runs any missed eval first.

**Argument summary** (full list in `scripts/train_orchestrator.sh`):

```
--total-steps     448            # final step count
--save-steps      50             # MUST match the training script's save_steps
--output-dir      /path/to/out   # where checkpoints land
--eval-data       /path/to/eval.jsonl
--history         /path/to/eval_history.jsonl
--lora-r          128
--lora-alpha      256
--epochs          2
--grad-accum      4
--base-model      Qwen/Qwen3.5-27B
--base-gguf       /path/to/base.gguf   # or env BASE_GGUF — required for EVAL_METHOD=llama
```

**Launch under nohup so it survives session close:**

```bash
cd /path/to/workspace
BASE_GGUF=/path/to/qwen3.5-27b-q8_0.gguf \
nohup ./scripts/train_orchestrator.sh \
    --total-steps 448 \
    --output-dir /path/to/output \
    --eval-data /path/to/eval.jsonl \
    --history /path/to/eval_history.jsonl \
    --lora-r 128 --lora-alpha 256 \
    > orchestrator.log 2>&1 &
```

### How the alignment math works

If you resume from `checkpoint-87` (e.g., a pre-eval-save callback wrote it at a non-aligned step), the orchestrator computes:

```
target = ((step / save_steps) + 1) * save_steps
       = ((87 / 50) + 1) * 50
       = 100
```

So segment 1 trains 87→100 (13 steps), trainer's auto-save fires at step 100, segment exits. Subsequent segments are full 50-step blocks (100→150, 150→200, …).

---

## Step 9 — Telegram alerts (optional but nice)

`scripts/tg_alert.sh` is a 50-line bash helper that sends HTML messages to a Telegram bot. Set up:

1. Talk to [`@BotFather`](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, create a bot, save the token.
2. Message [`@userinfobot`](https://t.me/userinfobot) `/start` and it returns your numeric chat ID immediately.
3. Store the credentials. **Quote the values** — Telegram tokens contain `:` and `_` and other characters that can confuse a `source` if the value isn't quoted:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/strix-halo
sudo tee /etc/strix-halo/telegram.env > /dev/null <<EOF
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<your-token>"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="<your-chat-id>"
EOF
sudo chown "root:$(whoami)" /etc/strix-halo/telegram.env
sudo chmod 0640 /etc/strix-halo/telegram.env
```

4. Test:

```bash
./scripts/tg_alert.sh "<b>Test</b> — Strix Halo guide setup OK"
# Should appear in your Telegram chat within ~1 second.
```

The orchestrator sends:

- 🚀 startup notice with current step
- ✅ per-segment success with eval_loss + Δ + perplexity + segment runtime + ETA
- ❌ segment failure with exit code + last 30 lines of log (HTML-escaped)
- ⚠️ eval failure (non-fatal — training continues)
- 🛑 SIGINT/SIGTERM (Ctrl-C handler with the latest checkpoint step)
- 🎉 final completion with total runtime

---

## Verified results

This guide was developed on a real production fine-tune. Excerpt from `eval_history.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"step":87,"eval_loss":0.1324,"eval_perplexity":1.1416,"eval_token_accuracy":0.9646,"n_samples":48,"timestamp":"2026-05-07T23:42:02Z"}
{"step":100,"eval_loss":0.1312,"eval_perplexity":1.1402,"eval_token_accuracy":0.9645,"n_samples":48,"timestamp":"2026-05-08T03:46:07Z"}
```

Each line is a complete eval run; subsequent segments append one line. The orchestrator's Telegram alert reads the bottom two entries and reports the delta.

Target: 448 steps total. Step time: ~11 min. Total wall-clock: ~4 days. GPU temp range during training: 60–72 °C with `power_dpm_force_performance_level=auto`. Peak GPU memory: ~80 GB reserved during training, ~73 GB during eval.

## Benchmarks & model selection

Fine-tuning is one workload; running the result (or any model) is another. These are measured numbers on this box — Radeon 8060S / gfx1151 / 128 GiB unified, ROCm 7.13 nightly — not vendor claims. Full logs and repro commands are in [`qwen36-bench/`](qwen36-bench/) and [`cublas-hipblaslt-sweep/`](cublas-hipblaslt-sweep/).

### Inference throughput — what to expect

| Model | Quant | tg (tok/s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | Q4_K_M | **~50** | MoE, 3 B active params/token — fastest interactive option |
| Qwen3.6-27B-MTP | Q4_K_M | ~12 raw / **~19 with spec** | bare-bench `tg64` is ~12 t/s; with the MTP+ngram-map-k4v spec stack via `llama-server` on `b9180+` (see §6b for the exact config) we measured a mean of ~19 t/s over 4 samples = ~1.58× speedup. Older builds or `llama-cli` will silently never dispatch the draft to the GPU. |
| Qwen3.5-27B (dense) | Q8_0 | ~7.5 | Full-precision dense — slowest, highest fidelity |

The spread is workload, not silicon. Decomposed:

| Change | Speedup |
|---|---|
| Q8 → Q4 (halves per-token memory bandwidth) | ~1.6× |
| 27 B dense → 35 B-A3B MoE (cuts compute per token to 3 B active) | ~4× |
| dense → MTP + speculative decoding | ~1.67× |

**Picking a model:** for an interactive assistant, a MoE-A3B model at Q4 wins outright — you pay compute for only the active experts. For maximum fidelity at a fixed memory budget, a dense model at Q8. MTP buys a speculative-decoding multiplier on top, *if* your llama.cpp build has the draft path enabled for gfx1151 (not all prebuilts do).

### `GGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS` — bench shape decides

A common r/StrixHalo tip is to build llama.cpp with `-DGGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS=ON` and run with `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=1`. We swept it on Qwen3.5-27B Q8 — it is **not** a free win; the sign of the effect flips with prompt-batch shape:

| Bench shape | CUBLAS=ON effect |
|---|---|
| `pp2048` (large prompt, FA on) | **+7%** at depth 0, decaying to flat by ~8 k context |
| `pp64` (small prompt) | **~3.6× slowdown** — forcing the rocBLAS GEMM path compiles out the MMQ kernels that win at small shapes |

If your real workload is large-prompt / batched (typical for fine-tune eval and RAG), the flag helps modestly. If it's short interactive prompts, it hurts badly. Measure your own shape before adopting it. Raw sweep: [`cublas-hipblaslt-sweep/`](cublas-hipblaslt-sweep/).

### `GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN` — turn it OFF on gfx1151

AMD's official guidance for RDNA 3.5 is to enable rocwmma flash-attention. On gfx1151 specifically, **don't.** The rocwmma FA path is dramatically slower than llama.cpp's runtime FA at any non-trivial context depth:

| shape (Qwen3.5-27B Q8 dense) | FATTN=ON | FATTN=OFF | OFF advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| pp2048 depth 0    | 283.90 | 331.86 | +16.9% |
| pp2048 depth 4196 | 167.61 | 306.83 | **+83%** |
| pp2048 depth 8392 | 117.08 | 282.52 | **+141%** (≈2.4×) |
| tg128 any depth   | ~7.5   | ~7.6   | flat (TG is memory-bandwidth bound) |

Same pattern on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4 MoE — +21% at d=0, +89% at d=4196, **+145% at d=8392**. The gap widens with context depth in both architectures.

Step 6 above uses `-DGGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=OFF` for this reason. Raw A/B + reproduction script: [`rocwmma-fattn-sweep/`](rocwmma-fattn-sweep/). The strixhalo.wiki [ROCWMMA recommendation](https://strixhalo.wiki/AI/llamacpp-with-ROCm#rocwmma) was correct; this is the hardware evidence.

> **Re-validated on kernel 7.0.9 (2026-05-29).** The numbers above were measured on 6.19.14. After upgrading the rig to mainline 7.0.9 (6.19 is EOL), we re-ran the identical sweep (same binaries/commit, only the kernel differing): pp2048 d8392 came out 120.9/284.1 t/s (2.35×) for the dense model and 334.5/809.0 (2.42×) for the MoE — within noise of the 6.19.14 figures. The 6.19.14→7.0.9 move is throughput-neutral here; the posted numbers stand. Full 7.0.9 logs: [`rocwmma-fattn-sweep/revalidation-7.0.9/`](rocwmma-fattn-sweep/revalidation-7.0.9/).

### ROCm vs Vulkan — backend selection depends on precision

Inference on Strix Halo can run through either of two llama.cpp backends, and **the right choice is not the same for every workload**:

- **ROCm/HIP** — the production backend this guide builds in [Step 6](#step-6--llamacpp-hip-build-for-inference). Used by all the numbers in the table above. Required for training (PyTorch + ROCm 7.13 nightly).
- **Vulkan (RADV STRIX_HALO)** — Mesa's Vulkan driver, with cooperative-matrix path. Built with `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON` (no HIP). Recipe in [`vulkan-vs-rocm-sweep/build-vulkan.sh`](vulkan-vs-rocm-sweep/build-vulkan.sh).

Tested on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at the same source commit (b9296), same hardware, same bench shape:

**Q4_K_M (quantized) — Vulkan wins decode by ~22%:**

| shape | ROCm/HIP | Vulkan | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| pp512 fa=1 | 1014.32 | 942.18 | ROCm (+7.7%) |
| tg128 d=0 | 49.58 | **60.39** | **Vulkan (+21.8%)** |
| tg128 d=8392 | 46.73 | **57.13** | **Vulkan (+22.3%)** |

**BF16 (full precision) — ROCm wins decode by ~117%:**

| shape | ROCm/HIP | Vulkan | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| pp512 fa=1 | **484.01** | 305.21 | **ROCm (+58.6%)** |
| tg128 d=0 | **23.71** | 10.73 | **ROCm (+121%)** ← over 2× |
| tg128 d=8392 | **23.09** | 10.64 | **ROCm (+117%)** |

**The reason** is visible right in Vulkan's own capability report on launch:

```
ggml_vulkan: 0 = AMD Radeon Graphics (RADV GFX1151) (radv) | uma: 1 | fp16: 1 | bf16: 0 | ...
                                                                    ^^^^^^^
                                                                no native BF16
```

`bf16: 0` — RADV STRIX_HALO supports FP16 cooperative matrix natively but not BF16; the Vulkan backend falls back to slower kernels for BF16 ops. ROCm/HIP has BF16 wired through native HIP matmul kernels and dominates anything BF16-bound.

**Practical recommendation:**

| Workload | Backend |
|---|---|
| Quantized inference (Q4/Q5/Q6/Q8) | **Vulkan** |
| Full-precision (BF16) inference | **ROCm/HIP** |
| Training (always BF16/FP32) | **ROCm/HIP** (only path with the PyTorch nightly stack) |
| Mixed | Whichever your hot path is |

## Upgrade-path gotchas

This guide pins specific versions (kernel, ROCm/PyTorch, llama.cpp, FLA, the HF stack). When you move off those pins, here's what actually broke for us and the fix — every entry is a transition we ran on this hardware, not speculation.

### Kernel

- **6.19.14 → 7.0.9 (mainline).** The 6.19 series went **EOL 2026-04-22**, so a fresh install should target the latest stable mainline (7.0.x). The `run-parts` double-directory `.deb` bug is **still present on the 7.0 `.deb`s** (the same six maintainer scripts) — re-run `scripts/fix-kernel-run-parts.py` on them exactly as in [Step 1](#step-1--kernel-61914-mainline). We validated 7.0.9 on gfx1151 (ROCm matmul + 128 GB GTT auto-size, no amdgpu faults, no step-time regression vs 6.19).
- **Floor.** AMD's stated minimum for gfx1151 is mainline **≥ 6.18.4** (or the Ubuntu 24.04 HWE **6.17** stack). Below that, the symptom is `torch.cuda.synchronize()` hanging with the GPU pinned at 100%, or an HSA page-fault at model load — the KFD/amdgpu queue+fence fixes for this silicon aren't present, so the ring never completes.

### ROCm + PyTorch (nightly)

- **torch 2.10.0 → 2.11.0 (rocm7.13 nightly).** Clean bump — the editable FLA install and the source-built bitsandbytes both survived it. Two things to keep in mind: always install from the per-arch index `https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2-staging/gfx1151/` (default PyPI pulls CUDA wheels), and from 2.10+ `expandable_segments:True` works on HIP (you can drop `max_split_size_mb`). See [Step 3](#step-3--pytorch-nightly--rocm).
- **gfx1151 is still not in any GA channel.** We checked: ROCm **7.2.3** GA and the stable `torch 2.12+rocm7.2` wheels do **not** carry working gfx1151 kernels (they fail with `HIP error: invalid device function`). Stay on the per-arch nightly index — every install command in this guide uses `…/v2-staging/gfx1151/`. (A `…/v2/gfx1151/` track also exists; we haven't validated it carries the same date-stamped `2.11.0+rocm7.13.0a*` wheels, so we don't use it.)

### llama.cpp

- **b867 → b9296.** Rebuilding **silently reset our local `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` Qwen3.5 V-head patch to upstream** — re-apply it after *every* pull/rebuild (Step 7c). We lost it in a rebuild once and it silently broke the eval path for days before anyone noticed. Unchanged across the bump: `--gcc-install-dir=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/13` is required on Ubuntu 24.04, `GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=OFF` on gfx1151, and moving the build tree breaks the binary's `RUNPATH`.

### flash-linear-attention

- **0.4.2 → 0.5.0/0.5.1.** Re-run `fla_repatch.py` after every FLA pull (it's idempotent). The historical patches (num_warps cap, the `cumsum.py` wrapper) were only needed on Triton 3.4 / ROCm 7.1 — on Triton 3.6 / ROCm 7.13 nightly, **vanilla 0.5.0 works** without them.

### HF training stack

- **trl 0.29.1 (last 0.x) → 1.x is a major, breaking bump** (packing-strategy rename `bfd-requeue`→`bfd_split`, changed `vllm_mode` default). This guide is pinned to 0.29.1 (stack table); validate your `SFTConfig` against 1.x before moving off it.
- **transformers < 5.2 → 5.2+** requires lazy shard loading for 27B-class models; older versions mmap all shards at once and OOM on unified memory.

### Re-apply after any rebuild/pull

One place to check whenever you bump these:

- **FLA:** `fla_repatch.py`
- **llama.cpp:** the `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` Qwen3.5 V-head patch (Step 7c)
- **bitsandbytes:** source build only (no ROCm PyPI wheels). The `libbitsandbytes_rocm83`→`rocm713` symlink (Step 5) is keyed to the HIP runtime version — re-check it after a HIP-major bump, and re-run the Step 5 build after a bnb source bump.

---

## What's still unsolved

We're not done; this guide is a snapshot, not a victory lap.

- **Eval still takes ~5–10 min per checkpoint** in the §7b path (more on eval-on-50 at 27 B). The base model has to mmap-and-mlock each time. A long-running `llama-server`-backed eval daemon that holds the model warm would amortize this; not built yet.
- **Why `INVLPGB` isn't exposed on Strix Halo.** Zen 5 architecturally supports it, but `/proc/cpuinfo` flags on the AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 don't list it. If it's a microcode-detection gap (kernel `arch/x86/kernel/cpu/amd.c`) or a genuine silicon non-implementation on Zen 5 mobile, we don't know — and we haven't dug. If `INVLPGB` were available the §7 storm class would collapse to one instruction system-wide. Worth a mailing-list inquiry to AMD's kernel team.
- **`PAGEVEC_SIZE = 31` is structural** in `include/linux/pagevec.h`. The `mm/vmscan.c` reclaim path batches dirty folios into folio_batches (the struct formerly called a pagevec; the `PAGEVEC_SIZE` macro name and value of 31 are retained) and fires `try_to_unmap_flush_dirty` every 31 entries. Tuning this (or wiring a sysctl knob) would proportionally cut the IPI rate on no-`INVLPGB` boxes. Real upstream `mm/` work; out of scope here.
- **The `convert_lora_to_gguf` Qwen3.5 patch isn't upstream yet.** Patch + verification snippet are in `patches/`. Until someone (you?) submits the PR to `ggml-org/llama.cpp`, anyone on Qwen3.5 LoRA needs to apply the patch manually.
- **`svm_range_restore_work` thrash** during heavy GPU bursts is an open AMD bug ([ROCm#5952](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/5952)). The Oct 2025 patch on amd-gfx covers only the MADV_FREE deadlock, not the CPU-hog-during-attention case. We work around it by exiting the training process between segments. This is a **different** issue from the §7 storm — it's GPU-side, while §7 is CPU-side.
- **Why `/srv` perms regress** is still unknown. We have a cron watchdog as defense in depth, but the actual postinst script doing the chmod hasn't been pinned down. If you find it, file a bug.
- **TRL `create_model_card` is fragile.** It calls `importlib.metadata.version("trl")` which traverses sys.path and silently fails if any `.dist-info` dir is unreachable. A more defensive trl would catch this.
- **PyTorch 2.11 nightly is unstable by definition.** Pin a specific date that worked for you.

## Upstream contributions

This guide isn't a static writeup — its gotchas get fed back to the projects that caused them. The validation dirs above are the evidence trail for work upstreamed to Unsloth:

| PR | Status | What it fixed | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| [unsloth#5517](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/5517) | **merged** | Injects `--gcc-install-dir` into HIP source builds so Unsloth Studio installs on Ubuntu 24.04 (the `'cstdlib' not found` failure) | [`pr-5517-validation/`](pr-5517-validation/) |
| [unsloth#5434](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/5434) | **merged** | Auto-installs `flash-linear-attention` + `tilelang` for the Qwen3.5 family. Our gfx1151 testing found `tilelang` is a hard regression on AMD; a HIP gate was added in response | [`pr-5434-validation/`](pr-5434-validation/) |
| [unsloth#5301](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/5301) | open | ROCm unified-memory detection for Strix Halo. We hardware-verified the detection fix, and caught its OOM guard misclassifying the Radeon 8060S as a discrete card | [`pr-5301-oom-guard/`](pr-5301-oom-guard/) |
| [unsloth#5303](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/5303) | open | Per-GPU lemonade-sdk llama.cpp prebuilts for ROCm hosts. Our end-to-end install test caught the runtime overlay omitting `librocm_kpack` / `librocm_sysdeps_*` libs | [`pr-5303-validation/`](pr-5303-validation/) |

Every entry here started as a real failure on a real run on the hardware this guide documents.

Built and tested on a Corsair AI Workstation 300 by [@h34v3nzc0dex](https://github.com/h34v3nzc0dex) ([ORCID 0009-0000-2537-1578](https://orcid.org/0009-0000-2537-1578)) with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic). Every patch in this repo was discovered by hitting a real failure on a real run and digging until we understood the root cause.

The community resources that got us most of the way:

- [AMD Strix Halo system optimization (official)](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/system-optimization/strixhalo.html)
- [AMD MI300A system optimization (official)](https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/amdgpu-docs/en/latest/system-optimization/mi300a.html) — our north-star tuning doc
- [Strix Halo Wiki](https://strixhalo.wiki) — cross-OEM firmware and kernel-param notes
- [Framework community fine-tuning thread](https://community.frame.work/t/finetuning-llms-on-strix-halo-full-lora-and-qlora-on-gemma-3-qwen-3-and-gpt-oss-20b/76986)
- [kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes](https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes) — llama.cpp-focused (pre-built Vulkan + ROCm containers), but the kernel parameter notes were a useful sanity check

If this guide helps you, [open an issue](https://github.com/h34v3nzc0dex/strix-halo-llm-finetune-guide/issues) with what worked, what didn't, and what hardware you're on. We'll fold it back in.

## Citing the benchmark data

The raw bench logs from `rocwmma-fattn-sweep/`, `vulkan-vs-rocm-sweep/`, `cublas-hipblaslt-sweep/`, and `qwen36-bench/` are also published as a Hugging Face dataset for stable citation: [**NorthstarAurora/strix-halo-bench-data**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NorthstarAurora/strix-halo-bench-data). Same files, same methodology; the HF version is the recommended citation target for papers and write-ups.
