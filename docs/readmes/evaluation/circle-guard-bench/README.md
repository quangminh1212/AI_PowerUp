# CircleGuardBench - A full-fledged benchmark for evaluating protection capabilities of AI models

**CircleGuardBench** is the first-of-its-kind benchmark for **evaluating the protection capabilities** of large language model (LLM) guard systems. It tests how well guard models block harmful content, resist jailbreaks, avoid false positives, and operate efficiently in real-time environments on a **taxonomy close to real-world data**. Created by [White Circle](https://whitecircle.ai?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=circleguardbench_launch&utm_content=repo)

- [Twitter Announcement](https://x.com/whitecircle_ai/status/1920094991960997998)

## What It Measures
- Harmful content detection across 17 critical risk categories
- Jailbreak resistance using adversarial prompt variations
- False positive rate on safe, neutral inputs
- Runtime performance under realistic constraints
- Integral score combining accuracy and speed for real-world readiness

## Key Features
- Standardized evaluation of multiple LLMs and guard models
- Support for major inference engines (openai_api, vllm, sglang, transformers)
- Custom taxonomy aligned with real-world abuse cases and moderation APIs (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- Integral scoring system that penalizes unsafe outputs and slow response times
- Leaderboard generation with per-category and macro-averaged scores

## Why It Matters
Most benchmarks focus on accuracy alone, ignoring critical production requirements like speed and jailbreak resistance. CircleGuardBench is the first benchmark to integrate accuracy, attack robustness, and latency into a single, practical evaluation framework — helping safety teams choose guard models that actually work in production.

## Configuration

### Models Configuration

Models are configured in `configs/models.json`. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "gpt-4o-mini (CoT)",
    "type": "llm_regexp",
    "eval_on": "all",
    "inference_engine": "openai_api",
    "params": {
      "api_model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
      "endpoint": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/"
    },
    "max_concurrency": 20,
    "use_cot": true
  }
]
```

### Prompt Templates

Prompt templates are stored in the `prompts` directory as Jinja2 templates. 

Check these templates for example of prompting with reasoning:
- `cot_prompt_eval_regexp.jinja`
- `cot_answer_eval_regexp.jinja`

### Supported Inference Engines

CircleGuardBench supports several inference engines:

- **openai_api**: For OpenAI models and compatible APIs (requires the `openai` package)
- **vllm**: For local model execution using vLLM (requires the optional dependency `vllm`)
- **sglang**: For running models locally using SGLang (requires the optional dependency `sglang`)
- **transformers**: For inferenceing classifiers, other models (like instruct llms) are not supported. (requires the optional dependency `transformers`)

To use the `vllm` or `sglang` engines, you need to install the corresponding optional dependencies.

## Dataset Format

CircleGuardBench uses a standardized dataset format. Below are the required columns and their descriptions:
