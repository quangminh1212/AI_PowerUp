ResearchClawBench is a benchmark that measures whether AI coding agents can **independently conduct scientific research** — from reading raw data to producing publication-quality reports — and then rigorously evaluates the results against **real human-authored papers**.

Unlike benchmarks that test coding ability or factual recall, ResearchClawBench asks: *given a curated scientific workspace and the same research goal, can an AI agent arrive at the same (or better) scientific conclusions?*

### 💡 Why ResearchClawBench?

Most AI benchmarks evaluate what models **know**. We evaluate what agents can **do**.

- **Real science, not toy problems.** 40 tasks sourced from published papers across 10 disciplines, each with curated experimental datasets.
- **Two-stage pipeline.** Autonomous research first, rigorous evaluation second — just like peer review.
- **Fine-grained, multimodal scoring.** A weighted rubric (checklist) with text and image criteria, judged by an LLM acting as a strict peer reviewer.
- **Agent-agnostic.** Ships with built-in support for Claude Code, Codex CLI, ARIS Codex, OpenClaw, Nanobot, EvoScientist, ResearchClaw, and a lightweight ResearchHarness baseline. Bring your own agent in one line.
- **From Re-Discovery to New-Discovery.** Scoring above 50 means matching the original paper; above 70 means *surpassing* it. The frontier is wide open.

## Understanding The Benchmark

### 🏗️ Data Construction

Every task in ResearchClawBench is built through a rigorous, expert-driven pipeline to ensure scientific validity and reproducibility:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["📄 High-Quality Paper Collection\n(Target Paper)"] --> B["🧑‍🔬 Human Expert Extraction\n(Core Task Instructions)"]
    B --> C["📋 Evaluation Rubric (Checklist)\n(Criteria + Keywords + Weights)"]
    B --> D["📂 Data & Related Work Collection\n(Datasets + Reference Papers)"]
    C --> E["✅ Human Reproduction & Validation\n(Verify rubric (checklist) is reproducible)"]
    D --> E

    style A fill:#e0f2fe,stroke:#0284c7,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#f59e0b,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#fce7f3,stroke:#ec4899,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f0fdf4,stroke:#22c55e,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#f5f3ff,stroke:#8b5cf6,stroke-width:2px
```

1. **High-Quality Paper Collection** — Domain experts select recent, high-impact publications with clear methodology and reproducible results across 10 scientific disciplines.

2. **Expert Task Extraction** — Human experts read each paper and distill the core research task into structured instructions, identifying the key scientific question, input data, and expected outputs.

3. **Rubric (Checklist) Design** — Experts create a fine-grained evaluation rubric (checklist) with weighted criteria (text and image items), each with specific technical keywords that a judge must verify.

4. **Data & Related Work Collection** — The datasets and related reference materials are curated to form a research workspace for the task.

5. **Human Reproduction & Validation** — Human researchers independently reproduce the paper's results from the provided workspace and instructions, verifying that every rubric (checklist) item is achievable. This ensures the benchmark is fair and the rubric (checklist) is grounded in reality.

### ⚙️ How It Works

ResearchClawBench operates in two distinct stages:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Stage1["Stage 1 &mdash; Auto Research"]
        A["Raw Data\n+ Instructions"] --> B["AI Agent\n(autonomous)"]
        B --> C["Code"]
        C --> G["Figures\n+ Report"]
    end

    subgraph Stage2["Stage 2 &mdash; Evaluation"]
        G --> D["LLM Judge"]
        E["Target Paper"] --> H["Rubric (Checklist)"]
        H --> D
        D --> F["Reasoning\n+ Per-Item Scores"]
    end

    style Stage1 fill:#f0f4ff,stroke:#3b82f6,stroke-width:2px
    style Stage2 fill:#fff7ed,stroke:#f59e0b,stroke-width:2px
```

#### Stage 1: Autonomous Research

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/auto-research.png" width="90%" />
<p><em>Auto Research view — file explorer, live code output, and real-time agent conversation</em></p>
</div>

The AI agent receives a workspace containing raw datasets, reference materials, and task instructions. It must independently:

1. **Explore** the data and understand the research question
2. **Write code** to analyze, model, and visualize the data
3. **Produce a research report** (`report/report.md`) with figures, methodology, results, and discussion

No hand-holding. No chain-of-thought hints. The agent works in its own sandboxed workspace with full tool access — just like a real researcher.

#### Stage 2: Reference-Based Evaluation

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/evaluation.png" width="90%" />
<p><em>Evaluation view — target paper (left), AI report (center), scored rubric (checklist) panel (right)</em></p>
</div>

Once the agent finishes, its report is evaluated against the **original published paper** using a fine-grained rubric (checklist). The judge receives the task instructions, the AI report, and the rubric (checklist) criteria — then scores each item using a **dual-mode rubric**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Inputs
        I["INSTRUCTIONS.md\n(task background)"]
        R["Agent Report\n(text + figures)"]
        TP["Target Paper"]
        CL["Rubric (Checklist)"]
    end

    TP --> CL
    I & R & CL --> J["Multimodal LLM Judge"]

    J --> DET{"Determine\nEvaluation Mode"}

    DET -->|"Quantitative\nresults"| OBJ["Mode A: Target Optimization\n(Comparison through quantitative indicators)"]
    DET -->|"Qualitative\nreasoning"| SUB["Mode B: Diagnostic Analysis\n(Comparison through logical evidence)"]

    OBJ --> SO["Score by metric\naccuracy vs paper"]
    SUB --> SS["Score by evidence\nstrength vs paper"]

    SO & SS --> T["Reasoning\n+ Per-Item Scores\n→ Weighted Total"]

    style Inputs fill:#f0f4ff,stroke:#3b82f6,stroke-width:2px
    style J fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#f59e0b,stroke-width:2px
    style OBJ fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#3b82f6,stroke-width:2px
    style SUB fill:#fce7f3,stroke:#ec4899,stroke-width:2px
    style T fill:#f0fdf4,stroke:#22c55e,stroke-width:2px
```

Each rubric (checklist) item includes:
- **Specific criteria** extracted from the paper's key contributions
- **Technical keywords** the judge must verify (e.g., *"ROC-AUC improvement"*, *"Monte Carlo integration"*)
- **Weight** reflecting the item's importance
- **Type** — `text` for methodology/findings, `image` for figure comparison (multimodal vision)

The judge automatically determines which evaluation mode applies to each item, then scores it with the corresponding rubric (see below).

##### Mode A: Target Optimization (Comparison through quantitative indicators)

For rubric (checklist) items involving specific numerical results, metrics, or quantitative outcomes:

| Score | Meaning |
|:------|:--------|
| **0** | Criterion completely absent |
| **1–10** | Mentioned but no quantitative results provided |
| **11–20** | Results given but methodology has fundamental errors |
| **21–30** | Significant methodological flaws; metrics deviate severely |
| **31–40** | Methodology mostly correct but metrics notably worse than the paper |
| **41–50** | **Metrics roughly comparable to the paper** |
| **51–60** | Metrics slightly better than the paper |
| **61–70** | Metrics clearly better than the paper |
| **71–80** | Methodology and metrics both substantially improved |
| **81–90** | Metrics dramatically surpass the paper |
| **91–100** | Breakthrough results far exceeding the paper |

##### Mode B: Diagnostic Analysis (Comparison through logical evidence)

For rubric (checklist) items involving theoretical explanations, mechanistic insights, or interpretive analysis:

| Score | Meaning |
|:------|:--------|
| **0** | Criterion completely absent |
| **1–10** | Mentioned only with vague, generic statements |
| **11–20** | Some description but no substantive analysis |
| **21–30** | Analysis attempted but evidence insufficient or logic has gaps |
| **31–40** | Correct direction but lacks depth; key arguments missing |
| **41–50** | **Analysis depth and rigor comparable to the paper** |
| **51–60** | More supporting evidence provided than the paper |
| **61–70** | More complete logical chain and more rigorous argumentation |
| **71–80** | Significantly deeper analysis with novel insights |
| **81–90** | Analysis depth far exceeds the paper |
| **91–100** | Original contributions with breakthrough insights |

> **Strict by design.** The judge is highly skeptical of AI-generated content — plausible-sounding claims must be backed by concrete evidence. Longer reports do not score higher. Substance over style.

### 🔬 Scientific Domains

Each domain contains **4 carefully curated tasks** with complete experimental data from real published research:

| Domain | Example Topics | Data Types |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Astronomy** | Black hole superradiance, Bayesian stellar inference | `.dat`, `.csv` |
| **Chemistry** | GNN molecular prediction, protein-ligand docking | `.pdb`, `.sdf`, `.csv` |
| **Earth** | Glacier mass balance, climate datasets | `.csv`, multi-region series |
| **Energy** | Battery degradation, renewable energy modeling | `.xlsx`, time series |
| **Information** | NLP benchmarks, deep learning analysis | `.pdf`, `.tex`, `.ipynb` |
| **Life** | Nanopore sequencing, genomic analysis | `.csv`, `.xlsx` |
| **Material** | Materials property prediction, pretrained models | `.pt`, `.csv` |

| **Neuroscience** | Neural decoding, brain signal processing | `.csv`, `.h5`, `.yaml` |
| **Physics** | Quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness | `.h5`, `.json`, `.csv` |

**40 tasks total** — each a curated research challenge selected from high-quality human-authored publications, spanning the full spectrum from data analysis to novel scientific insight.

### 🏆 Leaderboard

You can view the leaderboard on our [Website](https://internscience.github.io/ResearchClawBench-Home/), which is **updated in real time**.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/leaderboard.png" width="90%" />
<p><em>Leaderboard</em></p>
</div>

The built-in dashboard aggregates the best score per (task, agent) pair and displays:

- **Frontier chart** — best score per task across all agents
- **Leaderboard table** — clickable cells linking to individual runs
- **Per-task breakdown** — view any agent's report, code, and score reasoning

The frontier represents the **state of the art** — every point above 50 is uncharted territory where AI surpasses human researchers on that specific task.

## Using ResearchClawBench

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InternScience/ResearchClawBench.git
# If you only need to run evaluations, you can instead use:
# git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/InternScience/ResearchClawBench.git
cd ResearchClawBench
pip install -r evaluation/requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Download Additional Hugging Face Tasks (Optional)

The Hugging Face dataset mirror at [InternScience/ResearchClawBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InternScience/ResearchClawBench) currently includes **16 community-contributed tasks beyond the 40 tasks in this repository**, all packaged in the same `tasks/<TaskID>/...` layout.

If you want to use these extra tasks directly in this repository, set `--output-dir` to your local `tasks/` directory.

Download the helper script:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
curl -L -o download_tasks.py https://huggingface.co/datasets/InternScience/ResearchClawBench/resolve/main/download_tasks.py
```

Download all mirrored Hugging Face tasks:

```bash
python download_tasks.py --all --output-dir /path/to/ResearchClawBench/tasks
```

Download one or more specific tasks:

```bash
python download_tasks.py --task Astronomy_004 --task Physics_004 --output-dir /path/to/ResearchClawBench/tasks
```

The downloaded files are placed directly under that tasks directory, for example `/path/to/ResearchClawBench/tasks/Astronomy_004/...`.

Any task directory placed under `tasks/` with a valid `task_info.json` will be discovered automatically by the evaluation UI/API.

#### 3. Configure

Create `evaluation/.env` with your scoring model credentials:

```env
JUDGE_API_KEY=sk-xxx
JUDGE_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
JUDGE_MODEL_NAME=gpt-5.1
```

#### 4. Install Agents

Install whichever agent(s) you plan to benchmark. You do not need every built-in preset.

| Agent | Official installation guide | Notes |
|:------|:----------------------------|:------|
| **Claude Code** | [Claude Code overview](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) | Anthropic official docs |
| **Codex CLI** | [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) | OpenAI official docs |
| **ARIS Codex** | [Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep) | Imported runs are supported in the UI. The public preset is documentation-only for now; one-click launch is not yet supported. |
| **OpenClaw** | [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) | Official website and setup entry |
| **Nanobot** | [HKUDS/nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) | Official GitHub repository |
| **EvoScientist** | [EvoScientist/EvoScientist](https://github.com/EvoScientist/EvoScientist) | Official GitHub repository |
| **ResearchClaw** | [ymx10086/ResearchClaw](https://github.com/ymx10086/ResearchClaw) | `pip install` |
| **LingTai** | [Lingtai-AI/lingtai](https://github.com/Lingtai-AI/lingtai) | Official GitHub repository |
| **ResearchHarness** | [InternScience/ResearchHarness](https://github.com/InternScience/ResearchHarness) | Lightweight baseline harness for testing different LLMs; install with `pip install researchharness`. The Web UI preset still uses a local checkout path in `agents.json`. |

#### 5. Launch

```bash
python -m evaluation
```

Open **http://localhost:5000** — browse tasks, pick an agent, hit **Start Run**, and watch the research happen live.

#### 6. Score

After a run completes, switch to the **Evaluation** tab and click **Score**. The multimodal LLM judge evaluates each rubric (checklist) item and returns per-item scores with reasoning.

#### 7. Batch CLI Evaluation

For scripted LLM sweeps with ResearchHarness, use `python3 -m evaluation.cli_eval` or the repository-local `python3 rcb-eval` entrypoint. The CLI builds the same standard ResearchClawBench run workspaces used by the Web UI, runs the installed `researchharness` package, scores completed reports, and prints per-run and aggregate summary tables.

The CLI loads `evaluation/.env` and also respects environment variables set in the shell. The YAML intentionally separates the evaluated model from the judge model:

```yaml
agent_model:
  name_env: AGENT_MODEL_NAME   # model being evaluated
  api_base_env: AGENT_API_BASE
  api_key_env: AGENT_API_KEY

judge_model:
  enabled: true
  name_env: JUDGE_MODEL_NAME   # model used only for scoring
  api_base_env: JUDGE_API_BASE
  api_key_env: JUDGE_API_KEY
```

Real ResearchHarness batch runs also require tool credentials inherited by the installed `researchharness` package: `SERPER_KEY` for web/scholar search, `JINA_KEY` for web fetch, and `MINERU_TOKEN` for PDF reading. These can be placed in `evaluation/.env`; the CLI checks that they exist before creating any batch workspace and runs a lightweight tool preflight before each run. The preflight uses the exact same process environment as the real evaluation run, including any proxy-related variables; the CLI does not rewrite proxy settings. If tool calls fail in your local network environment, adjust or disable your proxy settings in the shell or `.env`, then rerun. Runs with failed tool preflight are marked as skipped and summarized in `eval_report_<batch_id>.md`.

Provider-specific OpenAI-compatible request options can be passed through `agent_model.extra_body`. For example, Qwen thinking mode can be toggled with `enable_thinking`; when thinking is enabled, keep `researchharness.max_output_tokens` high enough for the model to produce a final answer after thinking.

```bash
pip install -r evaluation/requirements.txt

# Edit agent_model, judge_model, tasks, repeats, and concurrency first.
cp eval_configs/researchharness_example_1_single_task.yaml eval_configs/my_eval.yaml

AGENT_MODEL_NAME=gpt-5.4 \
AGENT_API_BASE=https://your-agent-api.example/v1 \
AGENT_API_KEY=sk-agent-xxx \
JUDGE_MODEL_NAME=gpt-5.1 \
JUDGE_API_BASE=https://your-judge-api.example/v1 \
JUDGE_API_KEY=sk-judge-xxx \
SERPER_KEY=serper-xxx \
JINA_KEY=jina-xxx \
MINERU_TOKEN=mineru-xxx \
python3 -m evaluation.cli_eval eval_configs/my_eval.yaml
```

Provided examples:

- `eval_configs/researchharness_example_1_single_task.yaml`: one task with one repeat.
- `eval_configs/researchharness_example_2_mixed_repeats.yaml`: multiple tasks with different repeat counts.
- `eval_configs/researchharness_example_3_all_tasks.yaml`: all official tasks with `tasks: all`.
- `eval_configs/researchharness_example_4_qwen_thinking.yaml`: Qwen example with `agent_model.extra_body.enable_thinking`.

Useful validation command:

```bash
python3 -m evaluation.cli_eval eval_configs/my_eval.yaml --dry-run --skip-secret-check --no-score
```

Each CLI batch is written under `workspaces/cli_runs/cli_<timestamp>_<random>/`, with individual runs stored as `cli_<task_id>_<timestamp>_<random>/` subdirectories. The batch directory also contains `eval_report_<batch_id>.md`, which records the config metadata, runtime summary, run directories, trace directories, per-run results, per-task summary with duration columns, and overall statistics. Each run keeps the standard contents: `_meta.json`, `_agent_output.jsonl`, `report/report.md`, and `_score.json` when scoring is enabled. ResearchHarness events are captured in `_agent_output.jsonl` and also saved as sibling trace directories named `<run_id>_trace/` in the same batch directory. The role prompt is loaded from the installed `researchharness` package, so this CLI does not require a separate ResearchHarness checkout. The shorter `python3 rcb-eval eval_configs/my_eval.yaml` entrypoint is also provided.

After CLI evaluation, `python3 rcb-clear` prints a dry-run summary of duplicated task inputs under `workspaces/cli_runs/`, including reclaimable size and affected run counts. Use `python3 rcb-clear --yes` to delete only duplicated CLI inputs (`data/` and `related_work/` inside CLI run directories). Web UI runs, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, reports, code, outputs, scores, metadata, and ResearchHarness traces are preserved.

### 🤖 Supported Agents

ResearchClawBench ships with built-in support for Claude Code, Codex CLI, ARIS Codex, OpenClaw, Nanobot, EvoScientist, ResearchClaw, LingTai, plus a lightweight ResearchHarness baseline:

| Agent | Command | Notes |
|:------|:--------|:------|
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/anthropic.svg" width="16" /> **Claude Code** | `claude -p ...` | Anthropic, stream-JSON output |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/openai.svg" width="16" /> **Codex CLI** | `codex exec --full-auto ...` | OpenAI, full-auto mode |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/asx.svg" width="16" /> **ARIS Codex** | `One-click launch is not yet supported.` | Historical imported runs are supported in the UI; add your own local wrapper if you want to benchmark it interactively. |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/openclaw.svg" width="16" /> **OpenClaw** | `openclaw agent ...` | Self-hosted gateway, 3600s timeout |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/nanobot.svg" width="16" /> **Nanobot** | `nanobot agent -m ...` | Ultra-lightweight, reliable tool execution |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/evo.svg" width="16" /> **EvoScientist** | `evosci --ui cli ...` | Self-evolving AI Scientists |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/researchclaw.svg" width="16" /> **ResearchClaw** | `researchclaw agent -m ...` | AI research assistant with built-in skills |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/lingtai.png" width="16" /> **LingTai** | `cd <WORKSPACE> && lingtai-tui -p <PROMPT>` | Substrate for an AI organization |
| <img src="evaluation/static/logos/rh.svg" width="16" /> **ResearchHarness** | `python3 /abs/path/to/ResearchHarness/run_agent.py ...` | Lightweight baseline harness for testing different LLMs |

#### 🔧 Add Your Own Agent

Agent configuration is stored in `evaluation/agents.json`. To add a new agent, simply append an entry:

```json
{
  "my_agent": {
    "label": "My Agent",
    "icon": "M",
    "logo": "/static/logos/my_agent.svg",
    "cmd": "my-agent run -m <PROMPT> -w <WORKSPACE>"
  }
}
```

| Placeholder | Replaced With | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `<PROMPT>` | Prompt content (via file path or `$(cat ...)`) | Required. For `-p` style flags, replaced with file path; otherwise replaced with `"$(cat 'path')"` to pass content |
| `<WORKSPACE>` | Absolute path to the workspace directory | Optional. Only replaced if present in cmd |

The prompt injected into `<PROMPT>` is auto-generated from `evaluation/instructions_tmpl.py`, which combines a unified agent persona (autonomous execution guidelines, workspace sandbox rules) with task-specific instructions (description, data files, deliverables). All agents receive the exact same prompt — no code changes required, just edit the JSON file and restart the server.

### 📨 Submit New Tasks

The GitHub benchmark repository stays focused on the base 40 tasks. New task submissions should go through the [ResearchClawBench submission Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/InternScience/ResearchClawBench-Task-Submit), which validates the uploaded zip and opens a PR against the [Hugging Face dataset repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InternScience/ResearchClawBench) for maintainer review.

- Submission Space: [InternScience/ResearchClawBench-Task-Submit](https://huggingface.co/spaces/InternScience/ResearchClawBench-Task-Submit)
- Dataset destination: [InternScience/ResearchClawBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InternScience/ResearchClawBench)
- Example task format: [tasks/Astronomy_000](https://github.com/InternScience/ResearchClawBench/tree/main/tasks/Astronomy_000)

After a submission is merged into the dataset repository, you can download it into your local `tasks/` directory with `download_tasks.py`, and the evaluation UI/API will discover it automatically.
