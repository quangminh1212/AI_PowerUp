# ETHRoboticsClub/robosec-embodied-ai

Central hub for robotics security experiments : attacks, evals, ablations, and project pages across the research tracks.

# Embodied AI

Central hub for Embodied AI experiments within the Robotics Security Division: foundation model evaluation, adversarial robustness, and generalization research across robot policies and simulation environments.

## Experiments

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| [Experiment 1](experiment_1/README.md) | Test scene overfitting in robot foundation models | In progress |
| [Experiment 2](experiment_2/README.md) | Latent representation geometry at the S2→S1 interface of GR00T N1.6 | First result |
| [Experiment 3](experiment_3/README.md) | Adversarial visual patches on generalist robot policies | In progress |
| [Experiment 4](experiment_4/README.md) | Boundary task steering on frozen GR00T policies | Current result |
| [Experiment 5](experiment_5/README.md) | Embedding-space attacks on GR00T-N1.6: visual-patch quirks and the limits of pure-embedding hijacking | Wrapped up |


## Structure

Each experiment lives in its own folder (`experiment_N/`) with a README describing the hypothesis, setup, and results. Sub-experiments (e.g., per-model runs) are nested as `experiment_N/N.M/`.

## Contributing

To add a new experiment:

1. Create `experiment_N/` with a `README.md` and an `index.html` (the GitHub Pages entry point).
2. Add sub-experiments as `experiment_N/N.M/` if needed.
3. Register the experiment in the table above and on the [landing page](index.html).

A starting point is available in [`_template/`](_template/) — it mirrors the structure of Experiment 1. Feel free to ignore it and build your results page however works best for your data.
