# PRISM-9

## An Open-Source Framework for Governed AI Reasoning

After months of building complex AI pipelines, I kept hitting friction points that everyone in this space knows:

- Hidden reasoning I couldn't audit
- Rules getting "forgotten" mid-conversation
- Errors cascading without recovery
- Outputs I couldn't trace to sources
- Pipeline stages that didn't communicate reliably
- Hallucinated data slipping through undetected
- No way to enforce constraints consistently
- Inconsistent output formats breaking downstream processes
- Self-checks that couldn't actually catch mistakes
- No clear priority when instructions conflicted
- Context limits forcing me to drop critical information
- Hope-based validation instead of systematic verification (especially with complex tasks and large contexts)

That's how PRISM-9 evolved.

## What is it?

**PRISM-9** (Pipeline Reasoning with Integrated Self-Monitoring) is an AI reasoning and pipeline governance framework. It transforms opaque AI workflows into transparent, auditable systems.

## Core Innovations

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **The Laws Layer** | Rules designed to prevent fabrication and unverified claims. Guards against the most common failure modes. |
| **9-Step Meta-Reasoning** | COMPREHEND (understand inputs), ANALYZE (map subproblems), STRATEGIZE (choose approach), PLAN (sequence actions), EXECUTE (do the work), SELF_CHECK (verify against criteria), REFINE (strengthen output), RECONCILE (resolve conflicts), SYNTHESIZE (deliver result) |
| **Failure Recovery Loops** | Self-check fails? System automatically retries with a new approach. |
| **Schema-Driven Handoffs** | Typed contracts between pipeline stages for reliable data flow. |
| **Tiered Governance** | Laws > Hard Constraints > Soft Constraints > Preferences |

- API documentation with working examples
- Bug investigation with root cause analysis
- Migration planning with impact assessment

**Benefit:** Enforces schema-validated reviews. Designed for reproducible quality checks.

### Marketing & Content

- SEO content with research-backed writing
- Competitive intelligence with source verification
- Campaign planning with data-driven strategy
- Brand messaging with audience research

**Benefit:** Requires source verification. Designed to ground content in real data.

### Research & Analysis

- Market research with tiered source quality
- Trend analysis with pattern validation
- Feasibility studies with risk assessment
- User research with theme analysis

**Benefit:** Requires confidence calibration for findings. Enforces uncertainty documentation.

## Why Governance Matters

| Traditional Prompting | PRISM-9 |
|-----------------------|---------|
| "Hope it works" | "Verify it works" |

### The 5 Laws (enforced via validation gates)

1. Only state what's supported (cite the source)
2. Verify before claiming (run the check, then speak)
3. Block fabricated data (reject or flag anything without evidence)
4. Respect all constraints (laws > hard > soft > preferences)
5. Complete everything required (or return partial + errors if completion fails)
