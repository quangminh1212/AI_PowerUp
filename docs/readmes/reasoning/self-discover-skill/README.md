## What It Does

Most AI reasoning uses a single strategy (usually "think step by step"). This skill lets the AI **discover the optimal reasoning structure** for each specific task:

```
SELECT → ADAPT → IMPLEMENT → SOLVE
```

Based on peer-reviewed research showing **up to 32% improvement** over Chain-of-Thought and **>20% over Self-Consistency** with 10-40x less compute (Zhou et al., 2024, ICML).

**One file. Zero dependencies. Zero API cost.** The host AI composes its own reasoning structures.

## Before & After

<details>
<summary><b>Example 1 — Complex Debugging</b></summary>

**User:** *"My microservice throws intermittent 503s under load. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. No pattern I can see."*

**❌ Without Self-Discover:**
> This sounds like a capacity issue. Your service might be running out of resources under load. Check your CPU and memory usage during peak times. You might need to scale horizontally or optimize your code. Also check your database connections — connection pool exhaustion is a common cause. Consider adding circuit breakers and retry logic.

**✅ With Self-Discover:**
> Selected modules: Decomposition, Causal Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Constraint Satisfaction
>
> **Root cause candidates (ranked by likelihood):**
>
> | # | Hypothesis | Evidence to Check | Fix |
> |---|-----------|-------------------|-----|
> | 1 | Connection pool exhaustion | `SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected'` during 503 | Increase pool size + add timeout |
> | 2 | Thread pool saturation | `wrk -t12 -c400` + watch `ActiveThreads` in metrics | Switch to async I/O or increase worker count |
> | 3 | Downstream timeout cascade | Check upstream service latency at P99 during 503 window | Add circuit breaker, fail fast |
>
> **Debugging sequence:**
> ```bash
> # 1. Confirm it's load-dependent
> watch -n1 'curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://service/health'
> # 2. Check connections during 503 window
> netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l
> # 3. Compare against pool config
> grep -i pool application.yml
> ```

<details>
<summary><b>Example 2 — Architecture Decision</b></summary>

**User:** *"Should we use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time notifications?"*

**❌ Without Self-Discover:**
> Both work for real-time. WebSockets are bidirectional and SSE is server-to-client only. If you only need server push, SSE is simpler. If you need the client to send messages too, use WebSockets. Consider compatibility — SSE works everywhere, WebSockets might have proxy issues.

**✅ With Self-Discover:**
> Selected modules: Comparative Analysis, Constraint Satisfaction, Systems Thinking
>
> | Factor | SSE | WebSocket | Winner |
> |--------|-----|-----------|--------|
> | Direction | Server→Client | Bidirectional | Depends |
> | Reconnection | Auto (built-in) | Manual (heartbeat + reconnect) | SSE |
> | Protocol | HTTP/1.1+ (simple) | Upgrade handshake (complex) | SSE |
> | Binary data | No (text only) | Yes | WS |
> | Load balancer compat | Native HTTP | Requires sticky sessions/config | SSE |
> | Scaling | Easy (stateless connections) | Harder (stateful) | SSE |
>
> **For notifications (server→client, text-based, needs reliability): SSE.**
>
> ```javascript
> // Server (Express)
> app.get('/notifications', (req, res) => {
>   res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
>   res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');
>   const push = (data) => res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`);
>   subscribe(req.user.id, push);
>   req.on('close', () => unsubscribe(req.user.id, push));
> });
> ```
> Use WebSocket only if you need client→server real-time (e.g., collaborative editing, gaming).

<summary><b>Example 3 — Math Problem</b></summary>

**User:** *"A bat and ball cost $1.10 total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much is the ball?"*

**❌ Without Self-Discover:**
> The ball costs $0.10. The bat costs $1.00 more, so $1.10. Total is $1.10. ✓

**✅ With Self-Discover:**
> Selected modules: Critical Thinking, Constraint Satisfaction, Hypothesis Testing
>
> **Constraint setup:**
> - Bat + Ball = $1.10
> - Bat = Ball + $1.00
>
> **Substitute:** (Ball + $1.00) + Ball = $1.10 → 2 × Ball = $0.10 → **Ball = $0.05**
>
> **Verify:** Bat = $0.05 + $1.00 = $1.05. Total = $1.05 + $0.05 = $1.10 ✓
>
> The intuitive answer ($0.10) fails: $0.10 + $1.10 = $1.20 ≠ $1.10.

## How It Works

### 20 Seed Reasoning Modules

| # | Module | Best For |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Step-by-Step Thinking** | Sequential procedures |
| 2 | **Decomposition** | Multi-part problems |
| 3 | **Critical Thinking** | Evaluating claims |
| 4 | **Reflective Thinking** | Deep analysis |
| 5 | **Creative Thinking** | Open-ended design |
| 6 | **Pattern Recognition** | Data, sequences |
| 7 | **Analogical Reasoning** | Transfer learning |
| 8 | **Causal Analysis** | Debugging, diagnostics |
| 9 | **Constraint Satisfaction** | Optimization |
| 10 | **Abstraction** | Architecture, generalization |
| ... | *+ 10 more in SKILL.md* | |

### 4 Depth Levels (Auto-Selected)

| Level | When | Modules | Token Cost |
|:-----:|------|:-------:|:----------:|
| **0** | Simple Q&A | 0 | +0% |
| **1** | Most conversations | 1-2 | ~10% |
| **2** | Complex technical | 3-5 | ~25% |
| **3** | High-stakes / full discovery | 4-7 | ~40% |

No configuration. The agent picks the right depth automatically based on task complexity.

### Cross-Task Structure Transfer

Discovered reasoning structures transfer between similar tasks — use `memory/discovered-structures.md` to cache and reuse. Based on Zhou et al.'s finding that structures transfer across model families.
