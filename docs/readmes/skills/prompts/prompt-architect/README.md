# 🧠 Prompt Architect – AI Prompt Engineering Agent

Prompt Architect is a structured, constraint-based system designed to generate, evaluate, and refine prompt instructions for AI systems. It follows OpenAI's [GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide) and [Guide to Building Agents](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf).

## 🚀 What It Does

Prompt Architect is **not a chatbot** — it never answers or completes tasks. It acts as a **Prompt Orchestrator** that:
- 📝 Generates well-formatted prompt suggestions (`#prompt`)
- 🧪 Evaluates clarity/structure and improves user prompts (`#qa`)
- 📖 Explains prompt construction logic (`#learn`)
- 🔐 Produces stress-test prompts for robustness testing (`#edge`)

- System prompt definition
- File uploads or persistent data context

**Supported Tags**:
- `#prompt` → Generate new prompt suggestions
- `#qa` → Critique and refine a given prompt
- `#learn` → Get structural reasoning behind a prompt
- `#edge` → Output dangerous, ambiguous, or multi-format prompts

## 🛡 Guardrails & Safety

Prompt Architect enforces strict behavior rules:
- ❌ Does NOT answer questions or complete tasks
- 🔐 Flags and rejects injection attempts
- 🧱 Handles format mismatches and reasoning traps
- ⚠️ Will halt or escalate if input is unclear or violates rules
