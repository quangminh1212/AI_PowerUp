## Introduction

**Code Context LLM** bridges the gap between your codebase and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Without proper context, LLMs might **hallucinate** file structures or offer irrelevant suggestions, impacting developer productivity and code quality.

By generating a comprehensive **Markdown** outline of your project's directory tree, this tool empowers developers to enhance **prompt engineering**, improve **AI-assisted code navigation**, and facilitate **code understanding for AI** models. Ensure AI interactions are accurate, relevant, and aligned with your project's architecture.

## Features

- 🔒 **Secure Content Redaction**: Automatically redacts sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and credentials, allowing safe sharing of project structures. [Learn more about our security measures](#security).
- 🧠 **LLM Context Generation**: Provides accurate project context for improved LLM prompts, enhancing AI responses.
- 📂 **Respects `.gitignore`**: Excludes files and directories specified in your `.gitignore`, keeping your context clean.
- 🖥️ **Interactive React Ink UI**: A keyboard-driven terminal UI for selecting folders and reviewing exclusions.
- 🎯 **Override Exclusions**: Review items excluded by `.gitignore` or defaults and include them selectively.
- 📝 **Markdown Output**: Produces a readable and structured Markdown file for easy sharing and documentation.

## Installation

### Quick Start with npx

Get started instantly without installing:

```bash
npx code-context-llm
```

### Global Installation

Install the package globally to use it anytime:

```bash
npm install -g code-context-llm
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (React Ink)

Run:

```bash
npx code-context-llm
```

You'll be guided through:

- Selecting which top-level folders to include.
- Reviewing excluded items (from `.gitignore` and default skips) and choosing any to include.
- Confirming to generate the Markdown file (default: `ProjectStructure.md`).

Keyboard controls:

- ↑/↓: Move cursor
- ←/→: Collapse/Expand directories
- Space: Toggle selection
- a: Toggle select all
- Enter: Continue/confirm
- q or Esc: Quit

Notes:

- Dot-prefixed files and directories are excluded by default, but you can include them during the review step.

### Command-Line Options

- `[root]` (positional): Root directory to process (default: `.`). Examples:
  - `npx code-context-llm .`
  - `npx code-context-llm ./some-folder`
- `-o, --output-file <filename>`: Name of the output Markdown file (default: `ProjectStructure.md`).
- `-p, --project-path <path>`: Deprecated; use the positional `[root]` argument instead.
- `-h, --help`: Display help information.
- `-V, --version`: Display the version number.

## Use Cases

- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Enhance code summaries and refactoring tasks by providing LLMs with accurate project context, potentially saving up to **50%** of development time.
- **Codebase Documentation**: Automatically generate a Markdown outline of your project's architecture, reducing documentation effort by **up to 70%**.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Improve the accuracy of AI-powered code suggestions and bug detection by offering context about file relationships.
- **Team Collaboration**: Share project structures with team members to improve onboarding and facilitate code reviews.
- **Codebase Summarization**: Create summaries of large codebases for reviews or audits, helping you quickly understand unfamiliar projects.

## Example Output

Here's a snippet of the generated Markdown:

````markdown
# Project Structure for /path/to/your/project

- **src/**
  - **components/**
    - Header.js (1.2 KB)
      - Content preview:
        ```javascript
        import React from "react";
        // Header component
        const Header = () => {
          return <header>Welcome to My Project</header>;
        };
        export default Header;
        ```
    - Footer.js (800 bytes)
  - **utils/**
    - helpers.js (2.5 KB)
- **package.json** (1.1 KB)
  - Content preview:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "react": "^17.0.2"
      }
    }
    ```
````

This structured overview helps LLMs understand your project's architecture, improving code analysis and AI interactions.

## Security

Your project's security is our priority. **Code Context LLM** automatically redacts sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, and other secrets from code previews. We use pattern matching to identify and replace sensitive data with `[REDACTED]`. However, we strongly recommend that you **review the generated Markdown file yourself** to ensure that no sensitive information is included before sharing it.
