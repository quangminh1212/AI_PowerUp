# Agentic AI Engineering
**Stop reading about agents. Start building them.**

This is the repo for engineers who want to understand what's behind popular agents like **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **GitHub Copilot** and how to build one by yourself. From your first LLM call to a production eval harness.

> Building AI agents is engineering, not magic. Master the constraints, not the hype.

## ❓ Why you need to learn this?

Agent fluency is the new data-structures interview. We teach it **from first principles** - you build the loop, the tool calls, the memory, and the evals yourself before we ever introduce a framework. No magic. No black boxes. Just the primitives, in the order they were invented.

▶️ [Fundamental skills and knowledge you must have in 2026 for SWE](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxNl2grro6BiM_x9bGSH_xMOSl32fxvthr)

> _How many of you actually can pull out a whiteboard and build me an agent? Can you show me the inferencing loop?_
>
> **_If you don't know this, your career is in jeopardy._**
>
> _What is a tool call? If you don't know what that is, you need to learn what it is and all these basic fundamentals. I preference candidates if they know what a tool call is, how the inferencing loop works, pull out a whiteboard — the same way we used to say, show me a linked list, reverse me this data structure._
>
> _**This is now baseline knowledge** because we're getting candidates in that can answer this stuff._

💡 None of this requires fancy frameworks. Just an LLM API, some tools, and a loop.
**Build one this weekend. You'll understand agents better than reading 100 blog posts.**

No prior AI/ML experience required - just Python basics and **curiosity** about building LLM-powered agents.

## 🧭 Why this repo?

- **First principles, no black boxes.** You build the agent loop, the tool executor, the memory layer, the eval harness from scratch — _before_ we introduce a single framework. Learn what each abstraction is hiding before you let one hide it for you.
- **Runnable in one command.** `uv run --directory <tutorial> python <script>.py`. No conda dance. No Jupyter kernel hunt.
- **We take production agents apart.** The [_Disassembling AI Agents_](https://agenticloopsai.substack.com) Substack series reverse-engineers Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and OpenCode. You read how real agents work, then rebuild the pieces here.

## ⚡ 60-second quickstart

```bash
brew install uv   # or: pipx install uv
git clone https://github.com/agenticloops-ai/agentic-ai-engineering.git
cd agentic-ai-engineering
cp .env.example .env   # add your Anthropic and/or OpenAI keys

uv run --directory 01-foundations/01-simple-llm-call python 01_llm_call_anthropic.py
```

That's it. Every tutorial is self-contained and idempotent — you can jump in anywhere. Full setup details in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). Or [open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/agenticloops-ai/agentic-ai-engineering) and skip local setup entirely.

## 🗂️ Tutorials Structure

The tutorials are organized into **modules** (`01-foundations`, `02-effective-agents`) that progress from basics to advanced concepts. Each module contains numbered **tutorials** that build on previous lessons. Inside each tutorial folder, you'll find:

- **Python scripts** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11+-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white) - Self-contained, runnable examples demonstrating key concepts
- **README.md** - Detailed explanations, code walkthroughs, and learning objectives

You can explore individual scripts independently or follow the complete learning path from start to finish. Each module ends with a ![🏆 capstone](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏆_capstone-blue) project that combines all concepts from the module into a single, production-style agent.

## 📚 Companion reading

The tutorials teach you to build. Our [Substack](https://agenticloopsai.substack.com) gives you the mental model first - a foundational primer on how agents actually work, followed by teardowns of real production agents you use every day. **Read the post. Open the tutorial. Rebuild the pattern.**

[**How Agents Work: The Patterns Behind the Magic**](https://agenticloopsai.substack.com/p/how-agents-work-the-patterns-behind) - the core agentic loop from first principles. The four pattern levels (one-shot → single-tool → ReAct → planning), the role of the system prompt as behavioral design, and Ralph Mode as the outer loop. If you read one thing before opening the repo, read this. Pairs with → `01-foundations`.
