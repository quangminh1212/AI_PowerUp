   "Demonstrate how to detect and handle failures in an autonomous agent pipeline built with CrewAI (e.g., a web-scraping agent times out). Provide prompt or code templates for retry logic, fallback strategies, and alerting."
   ```

* **Evaluate Agent Performance Metrics**

   ```text
   "Define quantitative and qualitative metrics (e.g., task completion rate, avg. response time, accuracy) to evaluate an autonomous agent’s performance in Autogen, and show how to log and visualize these using a monitoring framework like Prometheus or Grafana."
   ```

* **Agent Orchestration with LangGraph**

   ```text
   "Write a LangGraph configuration that orchestrates three agents—ResearchAgent, AnalysisAgent, and NotificationAgent—with dependencies and data passing defined. Include sample YAML or JSON."
   ```

* **Secure Agent Actions**

   ```text
   "Explain best practices for sandboxing or restricting file, network, and system access for agents running under CrewAI. Provide examples of how to configure Docker containers or Kubernetes PodSecurityPolicies to enforce them."
   ```

* **Dynamic Prompt Refinement**

   ```text
   "Show how an Autogen agent can use its own logs or feedback loop to refine its prompts over time—e.g., if its summaries are too verbose, adjust the prompt to be more concise. Include code or pseudo-code in Python."
   ```

* **Integrate External APIs in Agents**

   ```text
   "Create a prompt template and runtime code for a LangGraph agent that fetches real-time stock prices from Alpha Vantage, processes them, and makes buy/sell decisions. Show how to plug in API keys and error handling."
   ```

* **End-to-End Agentic AI Demo**

    ```text
    "Compose a high-level README or tutorial that walks through building, testing (using Keploy), and deploying an agentic AI system with CrewAI or Autogen: from local development, through CI/CD, to production orchestration and monitoring."
    ```

### **17. RAG Application Development**

* **Generate a Complete RAG App Codebase (Python + LangChain)**  
  
  ```text
  ""You're a senior AI engineer. Build a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application in Python using LangChain and ChromaDB. The application should support:

  1. Document ingestion from PDF, Markdown, and CSV formats.
  2. Text preprocessing with chunking and metadata tagging.
  3. Embedding generation using either OpenAI or HuggingFace Transformers.
  4. Persistent vector store setup with ChromaDB (local mode).
  5. A retrieval pipeline that supports top-k semantic search.
  6. An interactive QA interface using Streamlit for user queries and answer display.

  Ensure code quality with modular file structure, comments, and environment setup files (requirements.txt). Use best practices for scalability and readability."
  "
  ```

* **Create a FastAPI Backend for RAG App**

  ```text
  "You're a senior AI backend engineer. Build a FastAPI-based backend to serve a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain or custom Python modules. The backend should expose relevant endpoints for uploading documents, querying questions, and retrieving responses — as defined in the user requirements. Integrate with a vector store like ChromaDB, and implement the RAG pipeline components: document ingestion, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and answer generation. Follow modular design principles and structure the codebase to support scalability, clarity, and future extension. Ensure the implementation meets the functional needs as defined above."
  "
  ```

* **Set Up Vector Store with ChromaDB**

  ```text
  "Provide Python code to set up a local ChromaDB instance for storing and querying document embeddings. Include functionality for creating collections, adding documents, and retrieving the top-k similar results for a user query."
  ```

* **Use HuggingFace Embeddings with FAISS**

  ```text
  "Write a Python script using HuggingFace Transformers to convert documents into embeddings and store them in a FAISS index. Enable functionality to search and retrieve the most relevant chunks based on cosine similarity."
  ```

* **Build a Streamlit UI for a RAG Chatbot**

  ```text
  "Create a Streamlit interface for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot. Allow users to upload files, ask questions, and receive contextual answers. Integrate with a backend that uses a vector store and a language model."
  ```

* **Generate Preprocessing & Chunking Pipeline**

  ```text
  "Design a text preprocessing and chunking pipeline for RAG. The pipeline should clean text, split it into overlapping chunks, and tag each chunk with metadata such as source, index, or timestamp. Optimize for embedding and retrieval accuracy."
  ```

* **LangChain RetrievalQA Pipeline with Prompt Template**

  ```text
  "Set up a RetrievalQA pipeline in LangChain using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings. Load documents, embed them, and create a prompt template to retrieve concise and context-aware answers to user queries."
  ```

* **Develop RAG App with Local LLM (e.g. Mistral-7B)**

  ```text
  "Build a RAG pipeline using a local language model like Mistral-7B. Include document ingestion, embedding via SentenceTransformers, ChromaDB for retrieval, and local inference for generating final answers."
  ```

* **Enable PDF Upload and Parsing for RAG**

  ```text
  "Add functionality to allow users to upload PDFs. Extract the text using PyMuPDF or pdfminer and convert it into clean, chunked segments for embedding and storage in the RAG pipeline."
  ```

* **Deploy RAG App on Render or Railway**

  ```text
  "Provide deployment instructions to host a RAG application on Render or Railway using FastAPI or Streamlit. Include a requirements.txt, Procfile, or Dockerfile for proper environment setup and execution."
  ```
