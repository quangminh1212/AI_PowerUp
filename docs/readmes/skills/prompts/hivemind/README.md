## What is Hivemind?

# Open-source AI engineering team that builds production code while you sleep

**If Claude Code is a _developer_, Hivemind is the _engineering team_.**

Hivemind is a Python orchestrator and React dashboard that turns AI coding agents into a full software engineering team. Give it one prompt — it plans the work, spins up specialist agents in parallel, passes artifacts between them, reviews the output, and commits tested code.

Under the hood: a LangGraph-based DAG executor, adaptive complexity triage, read-only code review, self-healing retry logic, and a single living DAG that grows dynamically as you send new messages.

**Ship features, not prompts.**

| Step | | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **01** | Describe the feature | *"Add JWT authentication with a login page and protected routes"* |
| **02** | Watch the team work | Triage → Architect → PM plans → Frontend + Backend + DB work in parallel → Tests → Review |
| **03** | Get production code | Tested, reviewed, committed. Open your IDE and it's already there. |

> **COMING SOON: Template Marketplace** — Download pre-built project DAGs and run them with one click. SaaS starters, API backends, full-stack apps — pick a template and let the team build it.

&nbsp;

| **Works with** | 🤖 Claude Code | 🦞 OpenClaw | 🧪 Codex | ⌨️ Cursor | 🐚 Bash | 🌐 HTTP |

*If it can write code, it's hired.*

&nbsp;

## Hivemind is right for you if

- ✅ You want to **describe a feature once** and get production-ready code back
- ✅ You're tired of **babysitting Claude Code** — typing "continue", fixing context loss, managing files manually
- ✅ You want **parallel execution** — frontend, backend, and tests built simultaneously
- ✅ You want a **read-only code review gate** that critiques without breaking your code
- ✅ You want to **monitor everything from your phone** while lying on the couch
- ✅ You want **self-healing** — when an agent fails, the system fixes it automatically
- ✅ You want **zero extra API costs** — runs on your existing Claude Code subscription

&nbsp;

**New message mid-execution?** It gets injected into the live DAG — adding or cancelling tasks dynamically. There is always exactly one DAG per project. No parallel DAGs, no lost messages.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Pipeline

| Stage | Component | File | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Triage** | `_triage_is_simple()` | `orchestrator.py` | Lightweight heuristic that routes simple tasks directly to a single-agent execution, skipping PM + Architect. Inspired by SEMAG adaptive complexity. |
| **Architect** | `ArchitectAgent` | `architect_agent.py` | Pre-planning codebase review. Produces an `ArchitectureBrief` (patterns, conventions, key files) that the PM uses for better planning. |
| **PM** | `create_task_graph()` | `pm_agent.py` | Decomposes the request into a `TaskGraph` — a DAG of typed `TaskInput` nodes with role assignments, file scopes, and dependency wiring. Task count scales with complexity (no forced minimums). |
| **DAG Executor** | LangGraph `StateGraph` | `dag_executor_langgraph.py` | `select_batch → execute_batch → post_batch → (loop)`. SQLite checkpointing for fault tolerance. Self-healing retry with failure classification. |
| **Review** | Read-only critic | `dag_executor_langgraph.py` | ACC-Collab Critic pattern: reviewer reads code but never modifies it. Automated lint/format runs separately with a test-after-review safety net — reverts if tests break. |
| **Memory** | `update_project_memory()` | `memory_agent.py` | Post-execution memory update. Lessons learned are injected into future PM prompts. |

### Concurrency Model

| Mechanism | Description |
|---|---|
| **Single DAG per project** | New messages are injected into the live DAG (add/cancel tasks), never spawning a parallel DAG. Messages arriving during PM/Architect phase are buffered and drained when the graph is ready. |
| **Writer/Reader separation** | Writer agents (code-modifying) run sequentially under a project write lock. Reader agents (analysis, research) run in parallel. |
| **Per-project write lock** | `asyncio.Lock` in `ProjectTaskQueue` prevents concurrent file modifications within the same project directory. |
| **Cross-project parallelism** | Different projects execute independently, bounded by `DAG_MAX_CONCURRENT_GRAPHS`. |

### Dynamic DAG

The DAG is a living structure. While execution is in progress:

- **User sends a new message** → PM decomposes it into additional tasks → tasks are injected into the live graph → executor picks them up in the next round
- **PM can cancel pending tasks** → tasks that haven't started are removed, dangling dependencies are cleaned up
- **Self-healing adds remediation tasks** → when a task fails, the executor creates a targeted fix task and adds it to the graph
- **`select_batch` re-evaluates every round** → newly injected tasks are discovered via `ready_tasks()` and `is_complete()`

### Typed Contract Protocol

Agents communicate via structured contracts, not free-form text:

```
TaskInput (goal, role, file_scope, depends_on, context_from)
    → Agent execution (two-phase: work + structured summary)
        → TaskOutput (status, artifacts, files_modified, handoff_notes)
```

Artifacts flow downstream through `context_from` wiring — a frontend agent automatically receives the API contract produced by the backend agent.

### Self-Healing

| Signal | Detection | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Agent stuck | Text similarity > 85%, no file progress | Reassign → simplify → kill & respawn |
| Task failure | Exit code, error classification | Targeted retry with failure context |
| Circular delegation | Watchdog pattern detection | Break cycle, direct assignment |
| Post-review regression | Tests fail after lint/format | `git reset --hard` to pre-review HEAD |
| Rate limiting (429) | Per-agent circuit breaker | Exponential backoff, other agents continue |

## ⚡ Features

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| 🧩 **LangGraph DAG Executor** | Tasks execute in dependency order via a LangGraph `StateGraph` with SQLite checkpointing, self-healing retry, and dynamic task injection. | 🔄 **Self-Healing Execution** | Failed tasks are classified by failure type and retried with targeted fixes — not blind restarts. |
| 🔀 **Artifact Flow** | Agents pass typed artifacts (API contracts, schemas, test reports) to downstream agents as structured context. | 🧠 **Proactive Memory** | The orchestrator injects lessons learned from past sessions to prevent repeating the same mistakes. |
| 🛡️ **Read-Only Code Review** | Reviewer critiques code without modifying it (ACC-Collab pattern). Lint/format changes are reverted if they break tests. | ⚡ **Adaptive Triage** | Simple tasks skip the full PM + Architect pipeline and execute directly — reducing latency and token waste. |
| 💰 **Zero Extra Cost** | No API keys needed. Runs directly on your Claude Code CLI subscription. No token charges. | 🔒 **Project Isolation** | Every agent is sandboxed to its project directory. Cross-project file access is blocked at multiple enforcement layers. |
| 📱 **Mobile Dashboard** | Real-time streaming, DAG progress, file diffs, cost analytics — all from your phone. | 🔌 **Circuit Breaker** | SDK client implements circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures when the LLM is overloaded. |
| 🏗️ **Architect Agent** | Pre-planning codebase review identifies patterns, conventions, and key files — giving the PM better context for planning. | 🔗 **Dynamic DAG** | Send new messages mid-execution — tasks are added or cancelled in the live DAG. Always one DAG, never parallel. |

&nbsp;

## Problems Hivemind solves

| Without Hivemind | With Hivemind |
| --- | --- |
| ❌ You ask Claude Code to build a feature. It works on one file at a time, loses context, and you babysit for hours. | ✅ Describe the feature once. The PM breaks it into a DAG, agents build in parallel, reviewer checks quality, code is committed. |
| ❌ For a full-stack feature, you manually coordinate backend → frontend → tests → review. Copy-pasting context between sessions. | ✅ Artifact flow passes API contracts, schemas, and test reports between agents automatically. No copy-pasting. |
| ❌ An agent gets stuck in a loop. You kill it, lose context, start over. | ✅ Self-healing detects stuck agents (5 distinct signals), reassigns, simplifies, or respawns — automatically. |
| ❌ You can't leave your desk. If you walk away, the agent stops or goes off track. | ✅ Monitor from your phone. The dashboard streams everything in real-time. Walk away. Go to the couch. |
| ❌ Agents write buggy code and you only find out after merging. | ✅ Read-only review gate catches issues before commit. If automated fixes break tests, they're reverted automatically. |
| ❌ Simple tasks go through the same heavy pipeline as complex ones, wasting tokens and time. | ✅ Triage routes simple requests directly to execution, skipping PM + Architect overhead. |
| ❌ You send a follow-up message and it starts a whole new session, losing all progress. | ✅ New messages inject tasks into the live DAG. One continuous execution, always growing. |

&nbsp;

## Why Hivemind is special

| | |
|---|---|
| **Adaptive complexity routing.** | Simple tasks skip PM + Architect and execute immediately. Complex tasks get the full pipeline. No wasted tokens. |
| **Single living DAG.** | There is always one DAG per project. New messages add or cancel tasks dynamically — never spawning parallel DAGs. |
| **Read-only code review with safety net.** | The reviewer critiques but never modifies code. Automated lint/format runs separately, and if tests break, changes are reverted to pre-review HEAD. |
| **Architect-informed planning.** | Before the PM creates a plan, the Architect Agent reviews the codebase and produces a brief — patterns, conventions, key files — so the plan fits the existing architecture. |
| **Two-phase agent protocol.** | Each agent runs a work phase (tools enabled) followed by a structured summary phase, guaranteeing parseable output. |
| **Structured Handoff Protocol.** | Agents write detailed handoff documents explaining *what* they built, *why*, and *how* to test it for the next agent. |
| **Project write lock.** | Writer agents are serialized within a project directory via `asyncio.Lock`, preventing git conflicts and race conditions. |
| **Active escalation.** | Watchdog monitors 5 stuck signals (text similarity > 85%, no file progress, circular delegation). Triggers reassign → simplify → kill & respawn. |
| **Exponential backoff with circuit breaker.** | Rate limits (429) are caught per-agent with retry strategy. Other agents continue working. |
| **Proactive memory injection.** | Past failures and lessons are injected into agent prompts so the team learns across sessions. |
| **Typed artifact contracts.** | Agents communicate via structured `TaskInput → TaskOutput` contracts, not free-form text. |

&nbsp;

## What Hivemind is not

| | |
|---|---|
| **Not a chatbot.** | Agents have jobs, not chat windows. |
| **Not an agent framework.** | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run an engineering team made of them. |
| **Not a workflow builder.** | No drag-and-drop pipelines. Hivemind models engineering teams — with roles, dependencies, artifacts, and quality gates. |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, use Claude Code directly. If you want a team — you need Hivemind. |
