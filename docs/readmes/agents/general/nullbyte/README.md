NullByte is a lightweight Electron-based desktop tool that gives you instant access to Google's Gemini AI while you code. It sits on top of your IDE, browser, or terminal as a non-intrusive floating panel — perfect for quick code explanations, debugging help, and on-the-fly learning.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** NullByte is designed as a **personal productivity and learning tool**. It is **not** intended for use during interviews, exams, proctored assessments, or any scenario where external assistance is prohibited. Please use this tool ethically and responsibly.

## ✨ Features

- **Always-On-Top Panel** — A floating panel that stays visible over your IDE, browser, or any other application so you can reference AI-generated solutions without switching windows.
- **Click-Through Mode** — The panel doesn't interfere with your workflow; mouse events pass through to the application underneath.
- **Global Hotkeys** — Control everything via keyboard shortcuts without leaving your current app.
- **Gemini AI Integration** — Leverages Google's latest multimodal AI models for intelligent code analysis and solutions.
- **Screenshot & Solve** — Capture a portion of your screen (error messages, code snippets, UI bugs) and let AI analyze it instantly.
- **Secure API Key Storage** — Your Gemini API key is stored with encryption on your local machine.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install via Homebrew (macOS)
The fastest way for macOS users to install NullByte and keep it updated is through our custom Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew tap 101yogeshsharma/nullbyte
brew install nullbyte
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ### ⚠️ macOS Security Note
> Because NullByte is currently an unsigned developer tool, macOS will block it from opening the first time with a "Apple could not verify..." warning.
>
> ![macOS Security Warning](assets/docs/mac_security.png)
>
> **To fix this, you have two options:**
>
> 1. **Terminal (Deep Clean):** Open your terminal and run the following command to remove the quarantine tag:
>    ```bash
>    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NullByte.app
>    ```
> 2. **System Settings:** 
>    - Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
>    - Scroll down to the **Security** section.
>    - Click **Open Anyway** next to the NullByte block notice.

*Note: You may be prompted to allow the application to open since it is an unsigned release currently.*

### 2. Install via Winget (Windows)
Windows users can soon install NullByte natively via Microsoft's Winget package manager!

```bash
winget install NullByte
```
*(Note: NullByte relies on central submission to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`. If the latest release isn't available immediately, give the pull request a few hours to merge).*

### 3. Manual Installation (Windows/Linux/Mac)

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

| Tool | Version | Download |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | v18 or higher | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **NPM** | Comes with Node.js | — |
| **Git** | Any recent version | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/101yogeshsharma/NullByte.git
cd NullByte
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Get a Gemini API Key

NullByte uses Google's Gemini AI under the hood. You'll need a free API key:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **"Get API Key"** → **"Create API Key"**.
4. Copy the key — you'll paste it into NullByte when you first launch it.

> **Note:** Your API key may have restrictions. If the default `gemini3 27B` model fails, try selecting another model from the app's dropdown menu.

### 4. Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run start
```

This launches NullByte directly. You can also use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build for Production

To create a standalone installer that you can share or install on any machine:

```bash
# To build macOS (.dmg)
npm run build:mac

# To build Windows (.exe)
npm run build:win
```

The output installers will be placed in the `dist/` folder.

> **💡 Tip for Git Bash / WSL users:** You can also use the included build script:
> ```bash
> chmod +x build.sh
> ./build.sh
> ```
> It handles dependency checks, cleans previous builds, and creates the `.exe` in one step.

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Launch** NullByte.
2. **Enter your API Key** — Get a free Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and paste it when prompted.
3. **Use keyboard shortcuts** to interact with NullByte:

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl + Shift + S` | Capture a screenshot (adds to queue) |
| `Ctrl + Shift + G` / `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` | Solve with AI |
| `Ctrl + Shift + D` | Solve (alternative shortcut) |
| `Ctrl + Shift + Q` | Toggle NullByte visibility |
| `Ctrl + Shift + X` | Clear screenshot queue |
| `Ctrl + Shift + M` | Toggle AI model selection |
| `Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Keys` | Scroll through the solution |

4. **Workflow**: Capture a screenshot of a coding problem or error → press Solve → read the AI-generated explanation and solution right in NullByte.

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Always-On-Top Window** — Built as an Electron `BrowserWindow` with `alwaysOnTop` enabled, using a frameless, transparent design for minimal visual footprint.
- **Click-Through** — Uses Electron's `setIgnoreMouseEvents` API so the tool doesn't block interaction with underlying apps.
- **Compact UI** — Uses a toolbar-style window to keep the interface minimal and out of the way.
- **Self-Hiding Capture** — NullByte temporarily hides before taking screenshots to ensure clean captures of the content beneath it.

## 🎨 Customization

- **Icon** — Replace `assets/icon.png` with your own 512×512 PNG.
- **Theme** — Edit the styles in `renderer/overlay.html` to customize colors, fonts, and layout.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `npm install` fails | Make sure you have Node.js v18+ installed. Run `node -v` to check. |
| NullByte doesn't appear | Press `Ctrl + Shift + Q` to toggle visibility. Check if the app is running in the system tray. |
| "Invalid API Key" error | Double-check your Gemini API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). Make sure there are no extra spaces. |
| Build fails with privilege errors | Run your terminal as **Administrator** and try again. |
| Screenshots are blank | Make sure you're not running the app in a virtual machine, as some VMs restrict screen capture APIs. |
