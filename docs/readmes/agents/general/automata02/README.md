  - Automatic labeling, tagging, and classification of files.
  - Smart suggestions based on file patterns and content snippets.
  - Integration-ready for AI/ML text analysis.

- **UI Monitoring & Automation**
  - Capture repetitive GUI interactions for automation (via AutoKey or simulated logic).
  - Macro manager to create, test, and schedule automation tasks.
  - Workflow dashboards to monitor live progress and metrics.

- **Autonomous Reporting Pipeline**
  - Automatic generation of weekly or custom reports.
  - Filter by labels, tags, or metadata.
  - Simulated PDF/HTML export for reports.
  - Preview and history tracking for all reports.

- **Advanced Dashboard**
  - Data visualizations: trends, top labels, activity metrics.
  - Real-time updates (simulated for demo).
  - Metrics cards and interactive Plotly charts.

- **Custom Rules Engine**
  - YAML-based rules to automate file moves, labeling, and tagging.
  - Dry-run simulation mode for safe testing.
  - Extensible for future AI-assisted rule suggestions.

- **Modular Design**
  - Streamlit-powered frontend, pandas-powered backend.
  - Well-structured folder architecture: `core/`, `pages/`, `utils/`, `config/`.
