🎮 AI Skill for Roblox Development — 5100+ lines of expert Luau/Roblox Studio knowledge for Claude Code, Antigravity IDE, and compatible AI assistants. Built with ❤️ from Indonesia 🇮🇩

---

# 🎮 Roblox Dev Skill — AI Coding Assistant for Roblox Development

An expert-level AI skill for Roblox game development with Luau. Designed for 
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai), [Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.dev), 
and any AI coding assistant that supports the Skills format.

> **Last Updated:** June 25, 2026 | **Engine Version:** v727+ | **Knowledge Status:** Mid-2026 Current

## What Is This?

A structured knowledge base that transforms your AI coding assistant into a 
**Roblox development expert**. When you mention anything Roblox-related, the skill 
auto-triggers and provides the AI with deep, accurate, research-verified knowledge 
about the Roblox platform.

### Key Features
- 🧠 **4,900+ lines** of curated Roblox development knowledge
- 🔄 **Self-updating** — built-in weekly freshness check with `/roblox-update` command
- 🎯 **Smart routing** — automatically selects the right reference based on your intent
- 🔌 **MCP integration** — works with the official Roblox Studio MCP server
- 🛡️ **Security-first** — server authority, input validation, anti-exploit patterns
- 📚 **Migration-aware** — guides you through deprecated APIs and breaking changes
- ⚡ **Context7 fallback** — looks up latest API docs when local knowledge isn't enough

## Installation

### Claude Code (Primary)

```bash
# Clone into your global skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/roblox-dev-skill.git roblox-dev
```

### Antigravity IDE / Gemini

```bash
# Symlink from Claude's directory (single source of truth)
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config/skills
ln -s ~/.claude/skills/roblox-dev ~/.gemini/config/skills/roblox-dev
```

Or install directly:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config/skills
cd ~/.gemini/config/skills
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/roblox-dev-skill.git roblox-dev
```

### Verify Installation

The skill is active when you see it listed in your AI assistant's available skills.
Test by asking: *"Create a coin collection system for my Roblox game"* — the skill 
should auto-trigger and generate server-authoritative Luau code with `--!strict` mode.

## Usage

### Auto-Trigger
The skill automatically activates when you mention Roblox-related topics:
- `Roblox`, `Luau`, `Roblox Studio`, `DataStoreService`, `RemoteEvent`
- `ProfileStore`, `Rojo`, `rbxl`, `rbxlx`, `game pass`, `obby`, `tycoon`
- Any Roblox Engine API reference

### Manual Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/roblox-update` | Trigger a full knowledge refresh from latest Roblox docs |
| *"update roblox skill"* | Natural language alternative for knowledge update |

### With Roblox Studio MCP
If you have the official [Roblox Studio MCP server](https://create.roblox.com/docs) 
connected, the skill can:
- Read/write scripts directly in Studio
- Execute Luau code for validation
- Search the game tree
- Run playtests and read console output
- Take screenshots for visual verification

## Knowledge Update System

The skill includes a **self-monitoring freshness system**:

1. On each trigger, it checks `metadata.json` for the `last_updated` timestamp
2. If more than 7 days have passed, it reminds you to run an update
3. Updates follow a strict protocol: **Research → Fact-check → QnA → Apply → Audit**
4. All decisions require user approval — the AI never auto-updates

### Manual Update
Say `/roblox-update` to trigger an immediate knowledge refresh.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Research-based only** — all content must be grounded in official Roblox documentation
2. **No improvisation** — if you're unsure, flag it as a question rather than guessing
3. **Update `metadata.json`** — bump version and add a changelog entry
4. **Run evals** — verify trigger accuracy with `evals/evals.json`
5. **Keep format consistent** — `--!strict` in all code examples, PascalCase for APIs
