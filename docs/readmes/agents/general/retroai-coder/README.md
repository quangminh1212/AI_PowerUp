## 🌑 Overview

**Novus IDE** transforms your Android device into a complete, portable software development workstation with a striking **Dark & Red** aesthetic. Built upon the robust foundation of Termux, it integrates a powerful **Autonomous AI Agent** directly into your terminal and code editor. 

Whether you are fixing obscure bugs on the go, writing complete applications, or managing remote servers, Novus IDE provides everything you need. It doesn't just autocomplete code—it **thinks, searches the web in real-time, and executes commands autonomously**.

## 🔴 Elite Features

- 🧠 **Autonomous AI Agent**: Beyond a simple chat. The AI can autonomously run terminal commands, create/delete files, and navigate your workspace to build full projects from a single prompt.
- 🌐 **Real-Time Web Search**: Native integrations with **Firecrawl**, **Tavily**, **Brave**, and **Serper**. If the AI doesn't know something or encounters a weird error, it will autonomously search the web for the latest documentation and solutions!
- 🎯 **@ File Tagging**: Type `@` in the AI chat to instantly summon a list of your project files. Select a file to instantly inject its entire codebase into the AI's context for pinpoint precision.
- 🚨 **Smart Error Solving**: Select terminal errors and tap "Fix with AI". The AI intelligently trims the log, pulls the exact surrounding code context, and delivers a concise code fix without wasting tokens.
- 💻 **Advanced Code Editor**: A full-featured native editor built for mobile. Enjoy syntax highlighting, file tagging, and an intelligent bottom bar.
- 🐧 **Full Linux Environment**: A complete Linux terminal experience powered by the Termux ecosystem. Access `apt` and `pkg` for Node.js, Python, Rust, C++, and more.
- 🎨 **Dark & Blood Red Aesthetic**: Designed for the night owls. A premium, aggressive dark theme with red accents that looks incredible on modern OLED mobile displays.
