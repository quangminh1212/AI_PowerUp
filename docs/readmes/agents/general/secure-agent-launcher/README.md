## 📌 What is Secure-Agent-Launcher?

Secure-Agent-Launcher is a tool designed to stop potentially risky artificial intelligence (AI) command-line programs from accessing sensitive files on your computer. It keeps your personal secrets — like SSH keys, AWS credentials, and system keychains — safe. The app watches every AI program run in your command line and decides if it's safe to access those private files. Every time it blocks or allows access, it keeps a record. This way, you get control over how AI tools interact with your machine.

Secure-Agent-Launcher works on macOS platforms. If you want to safeguard your development environment or secure your personal setup from AI commands that might misuse your private data, this tool is for you.

## 🔧 How to Use Secure-Agent-Launcher

### Monitoring AI Command-Line Tools

Secure-Agent-Launcher works quietly in the background. When you run a command-line AI tool, it checks whether the tool wants to access files like `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, or your keychain.

If the access seems safe, Secure-Agent-Launcher lets the AI continue. If it looks risky, the app blocks the attempt and tells you what happened.

### Viewing Logs

The software records every decision it makes. You can check the log to see what access attempts were blocked or allowed.

- Open the app.
- Click the "Logs" tab.
- Review recent activities to understand how the tool is protecting you.

These logs help you spot unusual behavior and keep track of the AI programs running on your system.

### Changing Settings

Secure-Agent-Launcher lets you set rules about what files AI tools can access. You can update these settings any time through the “Preferences” tab:

- Add trusted AI tools to a whitelist.
- Adjust which folders or files to protect.
- Turn notifications on or off.
