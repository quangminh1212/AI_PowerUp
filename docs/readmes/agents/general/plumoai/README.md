## 🧠 Powered By OpenClaw

PlumoAI integrates **OpenClaw** (We have added this as an AI Agent) to provide advanced reasoning and autonomous workflow execution.

AI Employees can:

🧠 Plan tasks
⚙️ Generate workflows
🔄 Execute multi step operations
📊 Interact with business systems

This enables true **autonomous execution** across company operations.

---

# 🏢 The Six Component Principle of an Employee

Every real employee is defined by **six core components**.

PlumoAI implements this architecture for AI Employees.

---

## 🎯 Role

Clear responsibility and scope of work.

Examples:

Sales Executive
Operations Manager
Data Analyst
Project Manager
Software Developer

The role defines the **outcomes the employee must deliver**.

---

## 🧰 Tools

Software and systems the employee can operate.

Examples:

CRM systems
Analytics platforms
Communication tools
Project management systems
Databases

Tools are connected using **AI Agents**.

---

## 🔐 Authorization

Permissions that define what actions an employee can perform.

Examples:

Read company reports
Write CRM records
Update databases
Access internal APIs

Authorization ensures **controlled and secure operations**.

---

## 🧠 Memory

Persistent knowledge across time.

Examples:

Past conversations
Customer interactions
Business decisions
Operational context

Memory enables **continuous learning and improved outcomes**.

---

## 📊 Accountability

Ownership of performance and results.

Examples:

Response time
Task completion
Accuracy of work
Operational outcomes

AI Employees are accountable for delivering results.

---

## 👤 Presence

How the employee interacts with the organization.

Examples:

Chat
Email
Audio communication
Video interaction
Future holographic or robotic interfaces

Presence determines how employees **participate in daily operations**.

---

# 🧩 AI Agent Ecosystem

PlumoAI supports an extensible ecosystem of **AI Agents**.

AI Agents connect external systems to the platform using MCP servers or any specific agent.

Examples:

📧 Email platforms
📊 Analytics tools
💬 Messaging systems
🗄 Databases
📈 CRM platforms
or some of like
Scheduler
Workflow Builder
Memory
ChartMaker
etc.

A single AI Employee (Just like human) can use **multiple AI Agents simultaneously**.

### Build or update an AI Agent tool

AI Agent tools live in `ai-agents/` in this repo and are mounted into the `ai-service` container at runtime.

- Guide: [AI Agent Tool Creation Guide](docs/AI_AGENT_PLUGIN_CREATION_GUIDE.md)

---

# 🗂 Built In Project Management Workspace

PlumoAI includes a full **project management system** where humans and AI Employees collaborate.

You can:

✔ Create projects and tasks
✔ Assign work to AI Employees
✔ Monitor execution
✔ Manage teams and operations

This makes PlumoAI not just an AI platform but a **complete operational workspace**.

---

## Production Installation (Docker Compose)

This repo runs PlumoAI as a **multi-container stack** (UI + APIs + AI service + MySQL + MongoDB + Milvus) behind Traefik.
For production, use **domain mode** (HTTPS with Let's Encrypt). For local evaluation/dev, use **localhost mode**.

### System requirements

- **Minimum**
  - **CPU**: 2 vCPU
  - **RAM**: **16 GB** (required; the full stack needs enough headroom for MySQL, MongoDB, Milvus, and services)
  - **Disk**: 30 GB free (SSD recommended)
- **Recommended (production)**
  - **CPU**: 4+ vCPU
  - **RAM**: 32+ GB
  - **Disk**: 100+ GB SSD (depends on file uploads + vector DB size)
- **Network (production / domain mode)**
  - Public IP + domain DNS `A/AAAA` → server IP
  - Inbound ports **80** and **443** open (Let’s Encrypt + routing)

### Windows (Production / Localhost)

#### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Docker Desktop with **Docker Compose v2**
- Git
- **Production (domain mode)**: domain `A/AAAA` record → your server IP, and open inbound **80/443**

#### Step 1: Clone

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/PlumoAI/plumoai.git
cd plumoai
```

#### Optional Step 2: Configure `.env` (recommended for production)

You can skip this step completely. **Step 3 will auto-create `.env`** from `.env.example` and (when run interactively) prompt you for required values.
For production or non-interactive installs, it’s recommended to create/edit `.env` yourself in advance.

**Domain mode (recommended for production):**

```ini
RUN_MODE=domain
DOMAIN_NAME=self.example.com
SSL_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```

**Localhost mode (HTTP):**

```ini
RUN_MODE=localhost
LOCALHOST_PORT=7861
```

#### Step 3: Install / Start (auto-creates `.env`, secrets, and starts containers)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

#### Step 4: Open

- Domain mode: `https://<your-domain>`
- Localhost mode: `http://localhost:7861`

#### Optional: Fresh install (resets MySQL volume)

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Fresh
```

#### Verify / Logs

```powershell
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail 200 -f traefik
```

---

### Linux (Production / Localhost)

#### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine + **Docker Compose v2**
- Git
- **Production (domain mode)**: domain `A/AAAA` record → your server IP, and open inbound **80/443**

#### Step 1: Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlumoAI/plumoai.git
cd plumoai
```

#### Optional Step 2: Configure `.env` (recommended for production)

You can skip this step completely. **Step 3 will auto-create `.env`** from `.env.example` and (when run interactively) prompt you for required values.
For production or non-interactive installs, it’s recommended to create/edit `.env` yourself in advance.

**Domain mode (recommended for production):**

```ini
RUN_MODE=domain
DOMAIN_NAME=self.example.com
SSL_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```

**Localhost mode (HTTP):**

```ini
RUN_MODE=localhost
LOCALHOST_PORT=7861
```

#### Step 3: Install / Start (auto-creates `.env`, secrets, and starts containers)

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

#### Step 4: Open

- Domain mode: `https://<your-domain>`
- Localhost mode: `http://localhost:7861`

#### Optional: Fresh install (resets MySQL volume)

```bash
./install.sh --fresh
```

#### Verify / Logs

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail 200 -f traefik
```

---

### macOS (Production / Localhost)

#### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop with **Docker Compose v2**
- Git
- **Production (domain mode)**: domain `A/AAAA` record → your server IP, and open inbound **80/443**

#### Step 1: Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlumoAI/plumoai.git
cd plumoai
```

#### Optional Step 2: Configure `.env` (recommended for production)

You can skip this step completely. **Step 3 will auto-create `.env`** from `.env.example` and (when run interactively) prompt you for required values.
For production or non-interactive installs, it’s recommended to create/edit `.env` yourself in advance.

**Domain mode (recommended for production):**

```ini
RUN_MODE=domain
DOMAIN_NAME=self.example.com
SSL_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```

**Localhost mode (HTTP):**

```ini
RUN_MODE=localhost
LOCALHOST_PORT=7861
```

#### Step 3: Install / Start (auto-creates `.env`, secrets, and starts containers)

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

#### Step 4: Open

- Domain mode: `https://<your-domain>`
- Localhost mode: `http://localhost:7861`

#### Optional: Fresh install (resets MySQL volume)

```bash
./install.sh --fresh
```

#### Verify / Logs

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail 200 -f traefik
```

### Common troubleshooting (all platforms)

- **DNS not pointing to the server** (domain mode): `DOMAIN_NAME` must resolve to your server’s public IP.
- **Ports blocked** (domain mode): open inbound **80/443** (cloud security group + OS firewall). Let’s Encrypt will fail if port 80 is blocked.
- **Non-interactive installs**: ensure `.env` is fully set (especially `DOMAIN_NAME` and `SSL_EMAIL` for domain mode).

### Optional: Update / change version (all platforms)

1) Set `PLUMOAI_VERSION` in `.env` (or keep the default).  
2) Re-run the installer for your OS (it will pull the new images and apply changes).
