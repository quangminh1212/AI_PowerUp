# Smikalo/logiquest

We wanted to build a system where your IDE, your physical peripherals, and your AI assistant work together to keep you in the "Flow State" - gamifying every line of code you write and every bug you squash for smoother development experience

# 🧙‍♂️ LogiQuest

### Turn your coding workflow into an RPG-style productivity experience.

LogiQuest is a **Kotlin Multiplatform** desktop application that transforms your workflow into an interactive retro RPG battle scene.
It integrates deeply with **Logitech MX Master 4**, **MX Mechanical**, and the **Logi Options+ SDK** to react to your typing, gestures, and context in real time — augmented by AI-generated smart macros.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🪄 Context-Aware RPG Overlay

* Detects your **active application**
* Generates a matching “monster” based on the app identity
* Updates dynamically as you switch windows

### 🧑‍💻 Workflow Avatar

Your developer avatar reflects your activity:

* **Defense Mode** → typing on the keyboard
* **Attack Mode** → executing Logitech smart gestures
* **Idle / Focus animations** → based on system context

### 🖱 Logitech Device Integration

Through a custom **Logi Options+ plugin**, LogiQuest receives:

* Smart Actions and button gestures
* Device events from MX Master 4 / MX Mechanical
* Mapped actions through the official Logitech UI

### 🔮 AI-Generated “Spell Cards”

Uses Google Gemini to create:

* Smart macros
* Command sequences
* Workflow shortcuts
* Voice-activated actions

Generated based on natural-language instructions.

Optional additional modules:

* Posture checking via camera
* Voice recognition
* Contextual workflow analysis

### 2. Build the Kotlin Desktop App

```bash
./gradlew :app-desktop:build
```

Run:

```bash
./gradlew :app-desktop:run
```

---

### 3. Install the Logitech Plugin

The repository includes a ready-to-use LogiQuest_1_0.lplug4 plugin under:

```
LogiQuestPlugin/bin/Release/net8.0/
```

Copy the generated plugin folder into:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\LogiOptionsPlus\Plugins\
```

Restart **Logi Options+**
→ You will see **LogiQuest Plugin** appear in the Smart Actions UI.

---

### 4. Configure Smart Actions

Open **Logi Options+** → Select your device → Smart Actions

Map any button or gesture to:

* **LogiQuest Attack**
* **LogiQuest Special Action**
* **LogiQuest Macro Trigger**

These will be sent to the Kotlin app via the local HTTP bridge.

## 📚 Use Cases

### 🚀 Productivity Gamification

Turn your coding session into an interactive RPG battle — maintain flow and reduce burnout.

### ⚔️ Gesture-Based Automation

Trigger AI-generated macros using hardware gestures.

### 🧠 AI Workflow Assistance

Ask for an action naturally:

> “Create a macro that opens my current GitHub repo and runs tests.”

LogiQuest generates a spell card automatically.

### 👁️ Posture & Health Awareness

Stay healthy while coding — slouching gradually lowers your character’s HP.

### 📱 Companion Device Integration (future)

Use your phone as:

* Spell inventory
* Dashboard
* Alerts console
