**AI-powered recruitment assistant for independent recruiters and small teams. A lightweight desktop app powered by Claude, with cloud embeddings for semantic matching — bring your own API keys, no subscription.**

---

## The Problem

Small and mid-size recruiting teams often work across industries they don't have deep expertise in. When you're filling a role in, say, compiler engineering or ML infrastructure, it's hard to quickly judge whether a candidate's resume actually fits — and even harder to write a credible outreach email that speaks to their background.

Open Recruiter solves this. Drop in a job description and a stack of resumes. The AI reads them, scores the fit, explains the gaps, and drafts a personalized email for each candidate — ready to send in one click. You don't need to understand the tech stack. The AI does the reading so you can focus on relationships.

**For job seekers**, there's a dedicated mode (Ai Chan) that searches for matching jobs on the web, analyzes your fit, and writes your cover letter.

- **Windows**: `.exe` installer
- **Linux**: `.AppImage`

**One-line installer** (macOS / Linux):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miao4ai/open_recruiter/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

```

### API keys (3.0+)

Starting with **3.0**, Open Recruiter is a lightweight cloud-backed build — no local models are bundled, so you provide your own keys in **Settings**:

- **Chat** — an **Anthropic** API key (Claude, the default) or an **OpenAI** key. Get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
- **Semantic search** — a **Voyage AI** key for candidate ↔ job matching. Free to start (200M tokens) at [dashboard.voyageai.com](https://dashboard.voyageai.com); leave it blank to fall back to keyword search.

> Earlier fully-offline releases remain on the [`old-version-2.2`](https://github.com/miao4ai/open_recruiter/tree/old-version-2.2) branch.
