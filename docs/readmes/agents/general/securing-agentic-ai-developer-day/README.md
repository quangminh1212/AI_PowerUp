_This Developer Day was given in March 2025 during NVIDIA GTC_. 

AI Adoption is transforming industries, organizations and daily operations – learn how to bring security fundamentals to the next generation of agentic AI application and deploy with confidence.

In this developer day, learn how to break down an agentic AI workflow, the [AI Virtual Assistant NVIDIA Blueprint](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/ai-virtual-assistant-for-customer-service) into its core components and: 
- Analyze the blueprint for sample attacks and threats
- Identify general security mitigations
- Discover weakness in the LLM model with `garak`
- Apply guardrails to mitigate LLM-specific weaknesses with NeMo Guardrails

## Structure

### Notebooks
The developer day contains several Jupyter notebooks that demostrate the usage of `garak` and NeMo Guardrails to discover model weakness and apply mitigations. 

Follow this order for notebooks: 
- `setup.ipynb`: Initial setup and configuration of API tokens 
- `garak_demo.ipynb`: Demonstration of Garak for LLM security testing
- `guardrails_demo.ipynb`: Demonstration of NeMo Guardrails implementation
- `guardrails_garak_demo.ipynb`: Combined demo of Guardrails and Garak
