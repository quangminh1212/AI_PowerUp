> **v1.0.7 — Memory & collections fixes, Windows ARM64 support.** Server Nexe now ships as a Tauri v2 desktop application with onboarding wizard, system tray, and automatic sidecar management. Available as **macOS DMG** (Apple Silicon), **Linux AppImage** (ARM64), and **Windows ARM64 installer** (unsigned — SmartScreen warns). See [Releases](https://github.com/jgoy-labs/server-nexe/releases/latest).
>
> **Linux note:** tested on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 virtual machines (UTM). CPU inference (Ollama) verified. If you test on native hardware or with GPU acceleration, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jgoy-labs/server-nexe/issues) with your results.
>
> **Windows note:** Windows ARM64 is supported since v1.0.7. The NSIS installer is unsigned — SmartScreen will warn: choose "More info" → "Run anyway". The installer handles WebView2; the app then installs Ollama (the inference engine on Windows) automatically on first run, from the onboarding wizard.

## The Story

Server Nexe started as a learning-by-doing experiment: *"What would it take to have your own local AI with persistent memory?"* Since I wasn't going to build an LLM, I started picking up pieces to assemble a useful lego for myself and my day-to-day work. One thing led to another — inference backends, RAG pipelines, vector search, plugin systems, security layers, a web UI, an installer with hardware detection.

**This entire project — code, tests, audits, documentation — has been built by one person orchestrating different AI models**, both local (MLX, Ollama) and cloud (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, Grok...), as collaborators. The human decides what to build, designs the architecture, reviews lines and runs tests. The AIs write, audit, and stress-test under human direction.

What began as a prototype has turned into a genuinely useful product: 7694 tests, security audits, encryption at rest, a macOS installer with hardware detection, and a plugin system. It's not done — there's a roadmap full of ideas — but it already does what it set out to do: **run an AI server on your machine, with memory that persists, and zero data leaving your device.**

This is not trying to compete with ChatGPT or Claude. But it can be complementary for less demanding tasks. It's an open-source tool for people who want to own their AI infrastructure. Built by one person in Barcelona, with AI as co-pilot, music, and stubbornness.

More technically: what was a **giant spaghetti monster** ended up distilling, refactor after refactor, into a **minimal, backend-agnostic (MLX / llama.cpp / Ollama), modular core** — where security and memory are solved at the base so building on top is fast and comfortable, in human–AI collaboration. Whether that worked is for the community to say (the AI says yes, but what did you expect 🤪).

## Why Server Nexe?

Your conversations, documents, embeddings, and model weights stay on your machine. Always. Server Nexe combines LLM inference with a **persistent RAG memory system** — your AI remembers context across sessions, indexes your documents, and never phones home.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Local & Private
Every conversation, document, and embedding stays on your device at runtime. No telemetry, no cloud calls during operation, no server that phones home. Initial install downloads the chosen LLM and the `fastembed` embedding model from Hugging Face or Ollama — after that, zero data leaves your device.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Persistent RAG Memory
Remembers context across sessions using Qdrant vector search with 768-dimensional embeddings across 3 specialized collections. Ingest documents, recall knowledge.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Automatic Memory (MEM_SAVE)
The model extracts facts from conversations automatically — names, jobs, preferences, projects — and stores them to memory inside the same LLM call, with zero extra latency. Trilingual intent detection (ca/es/en), semantic deduplication, and deletion by voice ("forget that...").

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Multi-Backend Inference
Switch between MLX (Apple Silicon native), llama.cpp (GGUF, universal), or Ollama — one config change, same OpenAI-compatible API.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Modular Plugin System
Auto-discovered plugins with independent manifests. Security, web UI, RAG, backends — everything is a plugin. Add capabilities without touching the core. NexeModule protocol with duck typing, no inheritance.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Desktop App
Tauri v2 desktop application for macOS (DMG), Linux (AppImage), and Windows ARM64 (installer, since v1.0.7). Onboarding wizard detects your hardware, picks the right backend, recommends models for your RAM, and gets you running in minutes. System tray, native menus, and automatic sidecar management.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Document Upload with Session Isolation
Upload `.txt`, `.md` or `.pdf` and they're automatically indexed for RAG. Each document is only visible within the session it was uploaded in — no cross-contamination between sessions.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Built to Grow
7694 tests (~85% coverage), security audits, i18n in 3 languages, comprehensive API. What started as an experiment is being built with production practices.

</tr>
</table>

## Quick Start

### Option A: Desktop App (macOS / Linux / Windows)

Download the latest package from **[Releases](https://github.com/jgoy-labs/server-nexe/releases/latest)**:

| Platform | Package | Size |
|----------|---------|------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `nexe-app_1.0.7_aarch64.dmg` | ~1.3 GB |
| Linux (ARM64) | `nexe-app_1.0.7_aarch64.AppImage` | ~1.2 GB |
| Windows (ARM64) | `nexe-app_1.0.7_arm64-setup.exe` (unsigned — SmartScreen warns) | ~1.3 GB |

The onboarding wizard handles everything: hardware detection, backend selection, model download, and configuration. The app runs server-nexe as a sidecar process with system tray integration.

### Option B: Command Line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgoy-labs/server-nexe.git
cd server-nexe
./setup.sh      # guided installation (detects hardware, picks backend & model)
nexe go         # start server on port 9119
```

Once running:

```bash
nexe chat               # interactive chat (RAG memory on by default)
nexe memory store "Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia"
nexe memory recall "capital Catalonia"
nexe status             # system status
```

### Option C: Headless (servers, scripts, CI)

```bash
# Config is passed as JSON on stdin — keys: model_key (a catalog key) and engine
echo '{"model_key": "qwen35_4b", "engine": "ollama"}' | python -m installer.install_headless
nexe go
```

**Endpoints at `http://localhost:9119`:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible chat API |
| `/ui` | Web UI (chat, file upload, sessions) |
| `/health` | Health check |
| `/docs` | Interactive API documentation (Swagger) |

> Authentication via `X-API-Key` header. Key is generated during installation and stored in `.env`.

## Backends

| Backend | Platform | Best for |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **MLX** | macOS (Apple Silicon) | Recommended for Mac — native Metal GPU acceleration, fastest on M-series |
| **llama.cpp** | macOS / Linux | Universal — GGUF format, Metal on Mac, CPU/CUDA on Linux |
| **Ollama** | macOS / Linux / Windows | Bridge to existing Ollama installations, easiest model management — the engine on Windows (installed automatically) |

The installer auto-detects your hardware and recommends the best backend. You can switch anytime in `personality/server.toml`.

## Available Models by RAM Tier

The installer organizes the 14 catalog models by the RAM available on your machine (4 tiers):

| Tier | Models | Origin |
|------|--------|--------|
| **8 GB** | Qwen3.5 4B | Alibaba |
| **16 GB** | Qwen3.5 9B, Qwen3.5 4B (8-bit), Gemma 4 E4B, Mistral Nemo 12B, Salamandra 7B | Alibaba, Alibaba, Google, Mistral AI, BSC/AINA |
| **24 GB** | Qwen3.5 27B, Mistral Small 3.2 24B, GPT-OSS 20B | Alibaba, Mistral AI, OpenAI |
| **32 GB** | Qwen3.5 35B-A3B, Gemma 4 31B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek R1 32B, ALIA-40B | Alibaba, Google, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, BSC (Barcelona Supercomputing Center) |

In addition, you can use any Ollama model by name or any GGUF model from Hugging Face.

## Plugin System

Server Nexe uses a duck typing protocol (NexeModule Protocol) — no class inheritance, no BasePlugin. Each plugin is a directory under `plugins/` with a `manifest.toml` and a `module.py`.

**5 active plugins:**

| Plugin | Type | Key features |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **mlx_module** | LLM Backend | Apple Silicon native, prefix caching (trie), Metal GPU |
| **llama_cpp_module** | LLM Backend | Universal GGUF, LRU ModelPool, CPU/GPU |
| **ollama_module** | LLM Backend | HTTP bridge to Ollama, auto-start, VRAM cleanup |
| **security** | Core | Dual-key auth, 6 injection detectors + NFKC, 49 jailbreak patterns, rate limiting, RFC5424 audit logging |
| **web_ui_module** | Interface | Web chat, sessions, document upload, MEM_SAVE, RAG sanitization, i18n |

## AI-Ready Documentation

The `knowledge/` folder contains 15 thematic documents × 3 languages = 45 files, structured with YAML frontmatter for RAG ingestion:

API, Architecture, Use Cases, Errors, Identity, Installation, Languages, Limitations, Plugins, RAG, README, Security, Testing, Threat Model, Usage.

Point any AI assistant at this repo and it can understand the complete architecture.

| Spanish | [knowledge/es/README.md](knowledge/es/README.md) |

## Security

Server Nexe includes a security module enabled by default:

- **API key authentication** on all endpoints
- **CSP headers** (`script-src 'self'` without `unsafe-inline`; `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` for Web UI)
- **CSRF protection** with token validation
- **Rate limiting** per IP
- **Input sanitization** — 6 injection detectors + Unicode normalization
- **Jailbreak detection** — 11 pattern speed-bump detector
- **Upload denylist** — blocks accidental upload of API keys, PEM keys
- **Memory injection protection** — tag stripping on all input paths
- **RAG injection sanitization** — `[MEM_SAVE:]`, `[MEM_DELETE:]`, `[OLVIDA|OBLIT|FORGET:]`, `[MEMORIA:]` neutralized at ingest and retrieval (v0.9.9)
- **Pipeline enforcement** — all chat through canonical endpoints only
- **Encryption at rest** — AES-256-GCM, SQLCipher. Default `auto`: encrypted when `sqlcipher3` is available (the DMG bundles it), otherwise plaintext with a startup `WARNING`. Set `NEXE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true` for strict fail-closed mode (v0.9.2+)
- **Trusted host middleware**

> **Note:** This project has not been tested in production with real users. Security testing has been performed by AI, not by professional auditors. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full disclosure and vulnerability reporting.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Backends |
|----------|--------|----------|
| macOS Apple Silicon (M1+) | **Supported** — all 3 backends | MLX, llama.cpp, Ollama |
| macOS Intel | **Not supported** since v0.9.9 | — |
| macOS 13 Ventura or earlier | **Not supported** since v0.9.9 (requires macOS 14 Sonoma+) | — |
| Linux ARM64 | **Supported** — AppImage + Ollama, tested on VM | Ollama |
| Linux x86_64 | **Supported** (Ollama, CPU) — unit tests pass | Ollama, llama.cpp |
| Windows ARM64 | **Supported** (v1.0.7) — unsigned installer, SmartScreen warns | Ollama |

> Since v0.9.9, server-nexe requires **macOS 14 Sonoma+ with Apple Silicon (M1 or later)**. The pre-built wheels in the DMG are `arm64` exclusive. Linux is supported with the Ollama backend (CPU). Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 VM. Native hardware validation on the roadmap. Windows ARM64 is supported since v1.0.7: the installer is unsigned (SmartScreen warns — "More info" → "Run anyway") and sets up WebView2; the app then installs Ollama automatically on first run.

## Requirements

RAM and disk are the same across platforms (they depend on the model you pick, not the OS). OS, CPU/arch and the available inference backend differ:

| | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OS** | 14 Sonoma+ | Ubuntu 24.04+ (tested on VM) | 11 ARM64 (since v1.0.7) |
| **CPU / arch** | Apple Silicon (M1+) | x86_64 or ARM64 | ARM64 |
| **Inference backend** | MLX + llama.cpp + Ollama | Ollama (+ llama.cpp on x86_64) | Ollama only |
| **Extra native deps** | — (bundled) | WebKitGTK 4.1 | WebView2 (installer handles it) |

| Common (all platforms) | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---------|-------------|
| **RAM** | 8 GB | 16 GB+ (for larger models) |
| **Disk** | 10 GB free | 20 GB+ free |
| **Python** | 3.11+ (only needed when installing from source; the installer bundles it) | 3.12+ |

> **macOS**: Apple Silicon only (arm64). Intel Macs and macOS 13 Ventura are no longer supported since v0.9.9.
> **Backends caveat**: models marked *"MLX Apple Silicon"* in the [model catalog](#available-models-by-ram-tier) run **only on macOS**. On Windows and Linux ARM64 (Ollama-only) those models are unavailable — pick an Ollama-backed model.

## Testing

7694 tests collected with ~85% code coverage. CI runs the full suite on every push.

```bash
# Unit tests (the suite lives under tests/)
pytest tests -m "not integration and not e2e and not slow" \
  --cov=core --cov=memory --cov=personality --cov=plugins \
  --cov-report=term --tb=short -q

# Integration tests (requires Ollama running)
NEXE_AUTOSTART_OLLAMA=true pytest -m "integration" -q
```

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## Limitations

Honest disclosure of what server Nexe **does not** do or does not do well:

- **Local models < cloud** — Local models are less capable than GPT-4 or Claude. That's the trade-off for privacy.
- **RAG is not perfect** — Homonymy, negations, cold start (empty memory), and contradictory information across time periods.
- **Partially OpenAI-compatible API** — `/v1/chat/completions` works. Missing: `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`, and function calling.
- **Single user** — Mono-user by design. No multi-device sync, no accounts.
- **No fine-tuning** — You cannot train or fine-tune models.
- **New encryption** — Added in v0.9.0 (default `auto` since v0.9.2; strict fail-closed only when `NEXE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true`). Not battle-tested. If you lose the master key, data cannot be recovered (see MEK fallback: file → keyring → env → generate).
- **Single developer, single real user** — Personal open-source project, not an enterprise product.
