## Overview

RapidFire AI is a new experiment execution framework that transforms your AI customization experimentation from slow, sequential processes into rapid, intelligent workflows with hyperparallelized execution, dynamic real-time experiment control, and automatic system optimization.

![Usage workflow of RapidFire AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidFireAI/rapidfireai/main/docs/images/rf-usage-both.png)

RapidFire AI's adaptive execution engine allows interruptible, shard-based scheduling so you can compare many configurations concurrently, even on a single GPU (for self-hosted models) or a CPU-only machine (for closed model APIs) with dynamic real-time control over runs.

- **Hyperparallelized Execution**: Higher throughput, simultaneous, data shard-at-a-time execution to show side-by-side differences.
- **Interactive Control (IC Ops)**: Stop, Resume, Clone-Modify, and optionally warm start runs in real-time from the dashboard.
- **Automatic Optimization**: Intelligent single and multi-GPU orchestration to optimize utilization with minimal overhead for self-hosted models; intelligent token spend and rate limit apportioning for closed model APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [NVIDIA GPU using the 7.x or 8.x Compute Capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
- [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.8+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
- [Python 3.12.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyTorch 2.8.0+](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) with corresponding forward compatible prebuilt CUDA binaries

### Install and Get Started


```bash
# Ensure that python3 resolves to python3.12 if needed
python3 --version  # must be 3.12.x

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install rapidfireai

rapidfireai --version
# Verify it prints the following:
# RapidFire AI 0.16.1

# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual Hugging Face token
# https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens
hf auth login --token YOUR_TOKEN

# Due to current issue: https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core/issues/527
pip uninstall -y hf-xet

# Depending on whether you want Fine-tuning/Post-Training or RAG/context eng., pick one of the remaining series of commands


# For Fine-tuning/Post-Training: Install specific dependencies and initialize rapidfireai

rapidfireai init --train
rapidfireai start

# It should print about 50 lines, including the following:
# ...
# RapidFire Frontend is ready
# Open your browser and navigate to: http://0.0.0.0:8853
# ...
# Press Ctrl+C to stop all services

# Forward this port if you installed rapidfireai on a remote machine
ssh -L 8853:localhost:8853 username@remote-machine

# Open an example notebook from ./tutorial_notebooks/[fine-tuning | post-training] and start experiment


# [OR]


# For RAG/Context Engineering Evals: Install specific dependencies and initialize rapidfireai
rapidfireai init
rapidfireai start

# It should print about 50 lines, including the following:
# ...
# RapidFire Frontend is ready
# Open your browser and navigate to: http://0.0.0.0:8853
# ...
# Press Ctrl+C to stop all services

# For the RAG/context eng. notebooks, only jupyter is supported for now and must be started as follows
rapidfireai jupyter

# Forward these ports if you installed rapidfireai on a remote machine
ssh -L 8850:localhost:8850 -L 8851:localhost:8851 -L 8853:localhost:8853 -L 8852:localhost:8852 username@remote-machine

# Open the URL provided by the jupyter notebook command above via your browser
# Open an example notebook from ./tutorial_notebooks/rag-contexteng/ and start experiment

```



### Troubleshooting

For a quick system diagnostics report (Python env, relevant packages, GPU/CUDA, and key environment variables), run:

```bash
rapidfireai doctor
```

If you encounter port conflicts, you can kill existing processes:

```bash
lsof -t -i:8850 | xargs kill -9  # jupyter server
lsof -t -i:8851 | xargs kill -9  # dispatcher
lsof -t -i:8852 | xargs kill -9  # mlflow
lsof -t -i:8853 | xargs kill -9  # frontend server
lsof -t -i:8855 | xargs kill -9  # ray dashboard
```

## Documentation

Browse or reference the full documentation, example use case tutorials, all API details, dashboard details, and more in the [RapidFire AI Documentation](https://oss-docs.rapidfire.ai).

## Key Features

### MLflow Integration

Full MLflow support for experiment tracking and metrics visualization. A named RapidFire AI experiment corresponds to an MLflow experiment for comprehensive governance

### Interactive Control Operations (IC Ops)

First-of-its-kind dynamic real-time control over runs in flight. Can be invoked through the dashboard:

- Stop active runs; puts them in a dormant state
- Resume stopped runs; makes them active again
- Clone and modify existing runs, with or without warm starting from parent's weights
- Delete unwanted or failed runs

### Multi-GPU Support

The Scheduler automatically handles multiple GPUs on the machine and divides resources across all running configs for optimal resource utilization.

### Search and AutoML Support

Built-in procedures for searching over configuration knob combinations, including Grid Search and Random Search. Easy to integrate with AutoML procedures. Native support for some popular AutoML procedures and customized automation of IC Ops coming soon.

```

## Architecture

RapidFire AI adopts a microservices-inspired loosely coupled distributed architecture with:

- **Dispatcher**: Web API layer for UI communication
- **Database**: SQLite for state persistence
- **Controller**: Central orchestrator running in user process
- **Workers**: GPU-based training processes (for SFT/RFT) or Ray-based Actors for doc and query processing (for RAG/context engineering)
- **Dashboard**: Experiment tracking and visualization dashboard

This design enables efficient resource utilization while providing a seamless user experience for AI experimentation.

## Components

### Dispatcher

The dispatcher provides a REST API interface for the web UI. 
It can be run via Flask as a single app or via Gunicorn to have it load balanced. 
Handles interactive control features and displays the current state of the runs in the experiment.

### Database

Uses SQLite for persistent storage of metadata of experiments, runs, and artifacts. 
The Controller also uses it to talk with Workers on scheduling state. 
A clean asynchronous interface for all DB operations, including experiment lifecycle management and run tracking.

### Controller

Runs as part of the user’s console or Notebook process. 
Orchestrates the entire training lifecycle including model creation, worker management, and scheduling, 
as well as the entire RAG/context engineering pipeline for evals. 
The `run_fit` logic handles sample preprocessing, model creation for given knob configurations, 
worker initialization, and continuous monitoring of training progress across distributed workers. 
The `run_evals` logic handles data chunking, embedding, retrieval, reranking, context construction, and 
generation for inference evals.

### Worker

Handles the actual model training and inference on the GPUs for `run_fit` and the data preprocessing and 
RAG inference evals for `run_evals`. 
Workers poll the Database for tasks, load dataset shards, and execute config-specific tasks: 
training runs with checkpointing (for SFT/RFT) and doc processing followed by query processing with 
online aggregation (for RAG/context eng. evals). Both also handle progress reporting.
Currently expects any given model for given batch size to fit on a single GPU (for self-hosted models).
Likewise, currently expects OpenAI API key provided to have sufficient balance for given evals workload.

### Experiment

Manages the complete experiment lifecycle, including creation, naming conventions, and cleanup. 
Experiments are automatically named with unique suffixes if conflicts exist, 
and all experiment metadata is tracked in the Database. 
An experiment's running tasks are automatically cancelled when the process ends abruptly.

### Dashboard

A fork of MLflow that enables full tracking and visualization of all experiments and runs for `run_fit`. 
It features a new panel for Interactive Control Ops that can be performed on any active runs.
For `run_evals` the metrics are displayed in an auot-updated table on the notebook itself, 
while IC Ops panel also appears on the notebook itself.
