# MinThu63/reasoning-agents-challenge

Fabric 365 is an 8-agent enterprise certification readiness system built on Microsoft Foundry. It uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning, ADORE RAG retrieval, and a governance pipeline (Policy Guard + Verifier) to deliver grounded, cited, and validated certification guidance — with live Azure AI Search and Microsoft Learn API integration.

# Fabric 365

**Enterprise certification readiness that reasons, not just retrieves.**

Fabric 365 evaluates Microsoft certification readiness by grounding outputs in approved content, adapting plans to workload, and enforcing governance before results reach users.

## Judge Snapshot

Fabric 365 is an **8‑agent reasoning system**, not a single chatbot.

- **Problem:** Certification programs rely on generic plans, weak readiness signals, and uncited AI advice.
- **Why multi‑agent:** Needs role mapping, prerequisites, capacity‑aware planning, engagement timing, grounded assessment, team analytics, and safety checks.
- **Architecture:** 8 focused agents coordinated through routed, sequential workflows.
- **Grounding:** Live Azure AI Search + Microsoft Learn for cited, approved content.
- **Safety:** Policy Guard screens PII, credentials, injection, and scope violations.
- **Quality:** Verifier checks citations, completeness, and consistency before release.
- **Human oversight:** Study plans require approval; low‑confidence routing asks for clarification.

---

## The Problem

| Pain Point | Reality |
|---|---|
| Generic plans | Ignore workload and realistic study windows |
| No readiness signal | Managers see “studying,” not exam readiness |
| Ungrounded AI | Recommends uncited or unapproved resources |
| No team view | Hard to see which teams are at risk and why |
| Uniform reminders | Same nudges for overloaded and free engineers |
| No gate | Outputs reach users without compliance review |

---

## The Solution

Fabric 365 decomposes readiness into **8 specialist agents** with clear roles and governed hand‑offs.

| Typical Approach | Fabric 365 |
|---|---|
| One chatbot | 8 specialized reasoning agents |
| One‑shot retrieval | Iterative, evidence‑first retrieval |
| Vague “step‑by‑step” | Named reasoning patterns across agents |
| Direct output | Policy Guard + Verifier before release |
| Static plans | Workload‑aware, revisable schedules |
| Assumed grounding | Every factual claim requires a source |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Fabric 365 routes each request through Mission Control, then either one specialist agent or a chained 8‑agent flow.

   🔗 CHAINED OUTPUT (when needed)

```

### Routing

**Single agent** when one task is enough:

| User Request | Agent | Why |
|---|---|---|
| “What certs for a Cloud Engineer?” | Curator | Role → certs |
| “How is TEAM-D doing?” | Manager Insights | Team view only |
| “Practice questions for AZ‑400” | Assessment | Question set only |
| “When should EMP‑056 study?” | Engagement | Schedule only |
| “Create a study plan for EMP‑034” | Study Plan | Plan only |

**Multi‑agent chain** when steps depend on each other:

| User Request | Chain | Why |
|---|---|---|
| “Help me prepare for AZ‑204” | Curator → Study Plan → Engagement | What → plan → reminders |
| “Get me end‑to‑end ready” | Curator → Study Plan → Engagement | Full preparation flow |
| “Am I ready for the exam?” | Assessment → Study Plan | Score → adjust plan |
| “Build a certification path for my team” | Curator → Study Plan → Manager Insights | Content → schedules → team view |

**Chain triggers:** `prepare`, `full plan`, `get ready`, `end to end`, `study path`, `am I ready`, `readiness check`, `should I take the exam`, `team plan`.

**Why chaining:**  
Curator defines **what**, Study Plan defines **when**, Engagement drives **follow‑through**, Assessment checks **readiness**, Manager Insights shows **team risk**.

### Governance Pipeline (runs on every response)

After the specialist agent (or chain) produces output, it passes through two governance gates before reaching the user:

```

## 🤖 The 8 Agents

### 1. Mission Control Agent — Orchestrator & Router

- **Function:** Classifies intent, extracts context, detects chain-worthy requests, and routes to the right agent. Uses ARM-pattern reasoning and returns a confidence score.
- **Input:** User request, optional conversation context.
- **Output:** Target agent, extracted fields, confidence score, reasoning trace.
- **Conditions:** Never answers domain questions directly. If confidence < 0.6, asks for clarification. Handles greetings and small talk without calling sub-agents.

---

### 2. Learning Path Curator Agent — Microsoft Learn / Exam-Tailored

- **Function:** Maps role and certification goals to the right Microsoft Learn path, skills measured, prerequisites, and approved resources.
- **Input:** Role, target certification, experience level, available study hours, optional skill gaps.
- **Output:** Ordered learning path, domains, resources, study sequence, estimated hours, source citations.
- **Conditions:** Rejects unknown certifications, unsupported resources, and cheating requests. Flags unsupported domains as `NO_APPROVED_SOURCE`.

---

### 3. Study Plan Generator Agent — Capacity-Aware Scheduling

- **Function:** Converts the learning path into a realistic weekly study plan using workload, focus hours, fragmentation, preferred slot, and prior progress.
- **Input:** Certification target, employee ID, optional deadline, learner progress.
- **Output:** Weekly milestones, target scores, hours per week, risk level, study slot, buffer week, fallback path.
- **Conditions:** Flags missing work data with `ASSUMPTION FLAG`. Marks impossible schedules as `CRITICAL_RISK`. Revises plans when new constraints appear.

---

### 4. Engagement Agent — Work-Context Reminders

- **Function:** Generates personalized reminder schedules based on work rhythm, progress, and collaboration load.
- **Input:** Work signals, progress score, completion status.
- **Output:** Weekly reminder schedule, tone, sample messages, escalation flag.
- **Conditions:** Rejects reminders before 08:00, after 21:00, during meetings, or above 2 per day. Falls back with `ASSUMPTION FLAG` if data is missing. Revises strategy if progress declines.

---

### 5. Assessment Agent — Grounded Question Generation

- **Function:** Generates grounded practice questions and evaluates readiness against certification thresholds.
- **Input:** Certification target, skill domains, current practice score.
- **Output:** 5 cited scenario questions, answer explanations, readiness rating, weak-domain recommendations.
- **Conditions:** Discards any unsourced question. Returns fewer than 5 only with gap flag. Rejects brain dumps and cheating requests. Highest citation threshold: **90%**.

---

### 6. Manager Insights Agent — Team Analytics

- **Function:** Summarizes team readiness, identifies risk patterns, and suggests likely causes using abductive reasoning.
- **Input:** Team ID or full-team view, aggregated learner and workload data.
- **Output:** Team health rating, metrics, patterns, inferred causes, recommendations.
- **Conditions:** Blocks employee-level data in team summaries. Labels hypotheses as inferred, not factual. Excludes null fields with `ASSUMPTION FLAG`.

---

### 7. Policy Guard Agent — 5-Layer Governance Gate

- **Function:** Screens every agent output before release.
- **Input:** Any agent output.
- **Output:** Layer-by-layer status and final verdict.
- **Layers:**  
  - PII scan  
  - Credential scan  
  - Grounding compliance  
  - Prompt injection detection  
  - Scope compliance
- **Conditions:** Blocks PII, credentials, injection, and scope violations. Flags grounding issues for Verifier. Returns `UNCERTAIN` when safety is unclear.

---

### 8. Verifier Agent — Quality Gate & REVISE Loop

- **Function:** Validates output quality before release and triggers one retry when needed.
- **Input:** Agent output, agent type.
- **Output:** `APPROVED`, `REVISE`, or `ESCALATE`, with layer scores.
- **Checks:** Citation coverage, completeness, internal consistency, assumption count.
- **Adaptive thresholds:**  
  - Assessment: **≥90%**  
  - Study Plan / Curator: **≥85%**  
  - Manager Insights: **≥80%**  
  - Engagement: **≥70%**
- **Conditions:** `REVISE` triggers one retry. `ESCALATE` requires human review.

## 🛡️ Safety & Governance

| Control | How It Works |
|---|---|
| **Policy Guard** | 5-layer check on every output: PII, credentials, grounding, injection, scope |
| **Verifier** | Adaptive citation thresholds: assessment=90%, plans=85%, reminders=70% |
| **REVISE Loop** | Failed verification auto-retries the agent with correction guidance |
| **Human Approval** | Study plans pause for user confirmation |
| **Routing Confidence** | Below 0.6 confidence → asks for clarification instead of guessing |
| **Anti-Extrapolation** | Agents flag assumptions explicitly with `ASSUMPTION FLAG` |
| **Source-Grounding** | Uncited claims trigger FLAG or DISCARD |
| **Red-Team Tested** | 5 adversarial scenarios: injection, PII extraction, brain dumps, scope bypass |

## 🔬 Anti-Hallucinating Reasoning Techniques

| Technique | Research | Where Applied |
|---|---|---|
| Chain-of-Thought | Wei et al. (2022) | All 8 agents — STEP 1→4 scaffolding |
| ADORE RAG | arXiv:2601.18267 | Curator, Assessment — iterative retrieval |
| Abductive Reasoning | Peirce (1903) | Manager Insights — hypothesizes causes |
| Analogical Reasoning | Gentner (1983) | Study Plan — compares similar learners |
| Nonmonotonic Reasoning | McCarthy (1980) | Study Plan, Engagement — revises on new info |
| Self-Consistency CoT | Wang et al. (2022) | Verifier — cross-checks quality |
| ARM-Pattern Routing | ICLR 2026 | Mission Control — routing as CoT |
| Layered-CoT | arXiv:2501.18645 | Policy Guard — 5-layer check |
| Few-Shot Constraints | Brown et al. (2020) | All specialist agents — correct + incorrect pairs |
| Deductive Reasoning | Classical AI | Business rules → employee decisions |

**Design note:** We use explicit CoT because `gpt-oss-120b` is a GPT-class model that benefits from step-by-step scaffolding (Wei et al. 2022). O-series models reason internally and would not need this.

## 🌍 Why This Approach?

Fabric 365 doesn’t just answer — it reasons, validates, and explains its work.

Every output is:
- **Grounded** — backed by cited source files or live Microsoft APIs
- **Reasoned** — chain-of-thought visible from STEP 1→4, with intent-aware routing and confidence thresholds
- **Refined** — uses analogical and abductive reasoning plus nonmonotonic revision when new signals arrive
- **Validated** — checked through safety (Policy Guard) and adaptive quality thresholds (Verifier)
- **Auditable** — full JSON trace saved for every pipeline run

Structured reasoning with safety rails, human oversight, and traceable, Microsoft-aligned decisions.
