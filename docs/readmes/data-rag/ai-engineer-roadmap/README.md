## 👋 Hey, before you start — read this

Most "Learn AI" resources do one of two things: they either throw math at you until you give up, or they hand you a ChatGPT wrapper and call it a course.

This repo does neither.

We start with **why things work**, then move to **how to build them**, and finally **how to ship them in production**. Every concept is explained in plain language first. Code comes second — and it's always Python.

You don't need a PhD. You need curiosity, consistency, and this guide.

    A[00 Prerequisites] --> B[00.5 What is an AI Engineer?]
    B --> C[01 Foundations]
    C --> D[02 Prompt Engineering]
    D --> E[03 LLM APIs]

Each stage builds on the last. Don't skip stages — the magic is in the connections.

## 📖 How to Use Each Module

Every module follows the same 5-step rhythm:

1. **Read the concept first** → `concepts/` folder — plain English, no code yet
2. **Follow the notebook** → `notebooks/` folder — step-by-step, run cell by cell
3. **Do the exercise** → `exercises/` folder — solidify what you learned
4. **Build the mini project** → every module has one, they get harder as you go
5. **Check the box** in your forked README

This rhythm works. Trust it.
