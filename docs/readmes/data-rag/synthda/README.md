# NVIDIA/synthda

SynthDa is a framework designed to make synthetic data generation for human actions more usable and accessible. This is a pose-level augmentation framework that generates synthetic training videos by interpolating real and AI-generated poses. It increases minority-class coverage, helping to mitigate data scarcity for rare actions.

**SynthDa** (aka **AutoSynthDa**) is an open-source toolkit that generates class-balanced, kinematically valid video clips by automatically **interpolating human poses** rather than rendering full photorealistic frames. The framework is designed to mitigate the issue of imbalanced datasets by creating synthetic data for minority action classes in action-recognition datasets without the need for additional sensors/modality. This only uses RGB videos to generate synthetic videos.  

Each component of our proposed framework can be swapped with models of your choice or components of your choice. For the augmentation optimization loop, we have used [action recognition net](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tao_tutorials/tree/main/notebooks/tao_launcher_starter_kit/action_recognition_net) from NVIDIA TAO Toolkit. We provided each of the components to be used individually or stringed together/automated for your specific use case. Our purpose is to enable improved synthetic data generation for human actions.

## Why Pose-Level Augmentation?

| Capability                                                | **AutoSynthDa (Pose)**            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Fine-grained motion control                               | ✅ Improved on prior works         |
| Independence from textures                                | ✅ Improved on prior works         |
| Maintaining semantic labels and kinematic plausibility    | ✅ Improved on prior works         |

*Pose-level synthesis potentially keeps the joint semantics explicit, reduces visual artifacts, and allows customizable generation speed and quality on NVIDIA GPUs.*

Note that this code has only been developed and tested with NVIDIA Processors.
