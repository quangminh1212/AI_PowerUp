## Why Chaty

- 🔒 **Truly private** — every model, document, and conversation stays on your device. No sign-up, no server, nothing phoned home.
- ⚡ **Native and fast** — a Rust + llama.cpp core with **Vulkan / Metal** GPU offload that auto-tunes to your hardware and falls back gracefully to CPU.
- 🧰 **More than a chat box** — a coding agent, a knowledge base (RAG), Deep Research, hands-free voice, and a self-healing Design Canvas — all offline.
- 🧠 **Runs almost anything** — Llama 3, Gemma 3 / 4, Qwen 3 / 3.5 / 3.6, *any* GGUF from Hugging Face — and **MLX models natively on Apple Silicon** — plus **Chaty's own fine-tuned model**.
- 💻 **Friendly to modest hardware** — a first-launch *“Set up for me”* picks a model sized to your RAM and downloads it in one click.

<br />

## A local coding agent

Flip the **Chat · Code** switch and Chaty becomes an agent for your codebase. Point it
at a folder, describe the task, and it explores, edits, and verifies the project by
itself — every step shown live, every change behind an approval + diff.

- 🌐 **The whole web as a tool** — key-less search of **GitHub** (repos, issues, *and code*), Reddit, YouTube, Bilibili, and any domain; fetching adapts to the content (articles → Markdown, PDFs → text, videos → transcripts).
- 🧭 **Drives a real browser** — opens pages, reads dynamic content as text, clicks and fills whole forms with real mouse events, logs in and paginates — and *looks* with the vision model when it matters.
- 🧠 **Tools that do the thinking** — `understand_repo` orients in one call, `search_code` ranks files by relevance, `read_file` lifts a single symbol plus its call sites, `validate_change` runs just the tests the change touches. Small models spend their steps on decisions, not grunt work.
- ✏️ **Precise edits, real shell** — exact-string patches behind a diff preview with a **syntax gate**, plus commands and long **background jobs** (dev servers, builds) sandboxed to the workspace.
- ⏪ **You stay in control** — per-action approval, a command allowlist, prompt-injection defense on everything it reads, and **one-click checkpoint rewind** that restores files *and* rolls back the conversation.

<details>
<summary>More Code-mode details</summary>

- Reads **PDF / Word / Excel / PowerPoint** (scanned PDFs get OCR'd); `search_files` finds by name or content; file outlines navigate big files; failed patches get “did-you-mean” hints.
- Browser automation is verified end-to-end against real sites, and can run in your real Chrome — watch it work, logins and all.
- Built for local models: an **Off / Normal / Deep** reasoning switch, a **prompt-processing progress ring**, a context-usage ring with automatic compaction, whole-file reads sized to your context window, ranked `search_code` + knowledge-base `search_docs`, and loop-breaking for repetitive small models.
- Persistent sessions, project memory (**AGENTS.md**), custom **/skills**, and slash commands.
- Tune it under **Settings → Code**: step limit, command timeout, step temperature, an auto-approve-edits toggle, a headless-browser toggle, and a command allowlist.
- File access never leaves the folder you pick; out-of-workspace access asks per folder; a `sudo` command asks first with a secure password prompt; downloads land in the workspace and are covered by checkpoints too.

## Benchmarks

One local model for every row — **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B** (MoE, ~3 B active per token), mxfp8 on MLX, reasoning off, entirely on one machine:

| SWE-bench Verified — 45-task macOS-validated subset | Resolved |
| --- | --- |
| **Chaty agent (v1.9)** — the full tool loop, 16K context | **15/45 (33 %)** |
| qwen-code 0.20 — the model family's own CLI (needs 32K) | 12/45 (27 %) |
| pi 0.81 — minimal 4-tool agent CLI | 10/45 (22 %) |
| opencode 1.18 | 7/45 (16 %) |
| bare bash agent — single-tool ablation | 6/45 (13 %) |

Same model, same tasks, same grading, one machine — five agent designs. Chaty leads the field, including the model family's own first-party CLI ([qwen-code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)) while using **half its context window**, and resolves **2.5×** the bare-bash ablation. That's the design thesis measured: with frontier models a thin scaffold is enough — on small local models, the intelligence has to live in the tools (repo-aware search, symbol reads, precise edits, recovery guards, post-edit diagnostics). Methodology, per-agent configs, and honest-comparison notes (subset, macOS harness — *not* comparable to leaderboard numbers): [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

## Design Canvas

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="docs/screenshots/canvas-hero-light.jpg" />
  <img src="docs/screenshots/canvas-hero-dark.jpg" width="860" alt="Design Canvas: live preview beside the actual source, element↔line inspect, console" />
</picture>

- **Preview | code, side by side** — every page opens as a split studio: live preview left, the **actual source** right, syntax-highlighted and palette-following. Three drag-resizable columns, fullscreen, page reload, and a **Console** tab for the page's logs and errors.
- **Point at what you mean** — Inspect links the panes both ways: hover an element and the code jumps to its line; click a code line and the element flashes. **Click to select** (⌘/Ctrl multi-select) and your next instruction edits exactly those elements — or open the source yourself with the **Edit** button.
- **Watch the edit happen** — iterations stream in Cursor-style: the code pane scans the document line by line and lands on a **Changes** diff (+N/−N, same language as Code mode).

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="docs/screenshots/canvas-scan-light.jpg" />
  <img src="docs/screenshots/canvas-scan-dark.jpg" width="860" alt="Live line-by-line scan while the model edits the page" />
</picture>

- **Self-healing, persistent** — runtime errors offer a one-click **Fix** (always asks first); a compat layer keeps browser-clean pages clean here too (history API, cookies, clipboard); and each reply keeps its canvas session across close/reopen, with version history, a confirmed reset, and export to a standalone `.html`.

<br />

## Chat that renders everything

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/shot-chat.jpg" alt="Rich chat rendering — syntax-highlighted code, tables, and KaTeX math" /></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/shot-chat-light.jpg" alt="The same conversation in Chaty's light theme" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

- A streaming, foldable **`<think>`** panel that follows the model's reasoning as it generates.
- **KaTeX** math, tables, **Mermaid** diagrams, per-block code copy, and in-app rendering of single-file HTML — including playable web games.
- A **⌘K command palette**, pinnable / renameable conversations, drag-and-drop attachments, export (Markdown / JSON), and full-text search.
- Four palettes (two dark, two light) with system-theme following, native UI zoom, reduced-motion support, and an **English / 简体中文** UI.

<br />

## Chaty can see

Load a **vision model** (its weights and `mmproj` encoder live together in one folder, paired automatically) and image understanding turns on everywhere:

- **Chat** — attach a picture and ask about it; follow-ups stay fast (already-seen images aren't re-encoded).
- **Code** — the agent reads screenshots and can look at any image with `view_image`; the composer takes images and documents just like chat.
- **Knowledge base** — imported images get a written description beside their OCR text, so search finds what's *in* them; images embedded **inside** PDFs, Word, Excel and PowerPoint files are extracted and described too.
- **Canvas** — the model sees the live rendered page when you ask for an edit.

Text-only models keep the OCR path, so nothing regresses — and updating from an older version, a one-time prompt tidies your existing loose `.gguf` files into the one-folder-per-model layout with a single click.

<br />

## Models: the store, native MLX — and Chaty's own

- A built-in **model store**: search Hugging Face by name or author, filter **GGUF / MLX**, sort by trending or downloads — then pick a **quantization** from a dropdown and hit download. Models, not file lists.
- Parameter / architecture / vision badges, the repo's README rendered in-app, and a **"fits fully in memory"** hint sized to your machine. Vision models fetch their encoder automatically; pasting a repo link still works.
- **MLX runs natively** on Apple Silicon: mlx-community folder models load through Apple's MLX stack in an isolated sidecar — same chat, vision, reasoning controls, Code agent and knowledge-base support as GGUF, and ejecting a model *always* returns its memory.
- **Chaty's own fine-tune** — a Qwen3.5-4B distilled from a much larger teacher for leaner on-device single-file web design, with a baked-in Chaty identity and grounded citations. A one-click pick in *“Set up for me”*, fully open on **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/stevenpr/chaty-qwen3.5-4b-design-GGUF)**.

<br />

## A private knowledge base

<table>
<tr>
<td width="52%">

- Index **PDF, Word, Excel, Markdown, ~90 text/code formats, and images** into an on-device store — one file or a whole folder. Images are read by **OCR *and*, with a vision model, described in words** so you can search what's *in* the picture.
- **Hybrid retrieval**: bge-m3 vectors + BM25 keywords, fused with RRF, de-duplicated with MMR, expanded with neighbors.
- **Strict grounding** — answers come only from your files, with **per-file citations** and hover-preview of the source passage. Chaty says when something isn't covered instead of guessing.
- **One-click report** — a cited, NotebookLM-style overview of the whole base, exportable to PDF or Markdown.

</td>
<td width="48%"><img src="docs/screenshots/shot-knowledge.jpg" alt="Local knowledge base — indexed documents with per-file toggles and one-click report / podcast" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />

## Deep Research & the web

- Give a topic and Chaty plans queries, runs **multiple rounds** of web search interleaved with reasoning, and writes a structured, cited report — **exportable to PDF or Markdown**.
- Honest by design: the reference list contains only sources it actually cited.
- A free, key-less, multi-provider search chain (Brave → Bing → DuckDuckGo → Wikipedia) so one blocked provider never breaks search.

<br />

## Hands-free voice

<table>
<tr>
<td width="48%"><img src="docs/screenshots/shot-live.jpg" alt="Live voice mode — an animated orb for continuous, hands-free conversation" /></td>
<td width="52%">

- **Live mode** — continuous, hands-free conversation with an animated orb.
- Voice in/out with silence auto-send and read-aloud — **11 voices** with speed control.
- **Deep-dive podcast** — turn your knowledge base into a NotebookLM-style two-host audio show, with WAV export.
- All voice runs on the **CPU**, so it never competes with the LLM for VRAM.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br />

## Everything stays on your machine

<table>
<tr>
<td width="52%">

- Conversations, models, and indexes live in one **local data folder** — copy it to back up, clear it in a click.
- **GPU acceleration**: cross-vendor **Vulkan** (Windows) and **Metal** (Apple Silicon, offload-all on unified memory), VRAM-aware auto-tuning with OOM back-off and CPU fallback.
- **Any `.gguf` — or MLX folder** — tokenizer and chat template come from the model itself; first-class handling for Llama 3, Gemma 3 / 4, and Qwen 3 / 3.5 / 3.6.
- **Adjustable context** that auto-fits the model's trained length to your memory and summarizes older turns near the limit; **safe model switching** and full sampling controls with saveable presets.

</td>
<td width="48%"><img src="docs/screenshots/shot-settings.jpg" alt="Settings — a local data dashboard showing conversations, models, and knowledge-base stats" /></td>

> **Offline-first.** The network is used only for optional web search and one-time model downloads.

## Install

Grab the latest build from the [**Releases**](../../releases) page:

| Platform | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `Chaty_*_x64-setup.exe` | Per-user installer — no admin required |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Chaty_*_aarch64.dmg` | See the first-launch note below |

**macOS first launch.** Chaty is ad-hoc signed but not notarized (there's no paid Apple
Developer account behind it), so Gatekeeper warns on first open. The app is safe — everything
runs locally. Clear the download quarantine once:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Chaty.app
```

then open Chaty normally. (Or: open it, dismiss the warning, and choose **System Settings →
Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.) On macOS the writable models folder lives in app data —
use **Open models folder** in the model menu.

## Build

Full details in **[BUILD.md](BUILD.md)**.

```powershell
# Windows
npm install
.\dev.ps1                            # dev
npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle   # release exe → compile the Inno installer
```

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # dev (Metal)
npm run tauri build    # → .app + .dmg
```

Releases are produced by CI: bump with `scripts/bump-version.sh x.y.z`, then push a `vx.y.z`
tag — GitHub Actions builds both installers onto a single release.
