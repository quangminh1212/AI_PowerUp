> **⚠️ Project Status:** This project is temporarily on hold, but updates will resume soon. I am currently rewriting some sections to speed up generation by up to 50x and increase generation volume to 10,000+ candidates per inference.
## About The Project
**PassLLM is the world's most accurate targeted password guessing framework**, [outperforming other models by 15% to 45%](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/zou-yunkai) in most scenarios. It uses Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - such as _names, birthdays, phone numbers, emails and previous passwords_ - to predict the specific passwords a target is most likely to use. 
The model fine-tunes 7B/4B parameter LLMs on millions of leaked PII records using LoRA, enabling a private, high-accuracy framework that runs entirely on consumer PCs.

## Capabilities

* **State-of-the-Art Accuracy:** Achieves **+45% higher success rates** than leading benchmarks (RankGuess, TarGuess) in most scenarios.
* **PII Inference:** With sufficient information, it successfully guesses **12.5% - 31.6%** of typical users within just **100 guesses**.
* **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Custom training loop utilizing *LoRA* to lower VRAM usage without sacrificing model reasoning capabilities.
* **Advanced Inference:** Implements the paper's algorithm to maximize probability, prioritizing the most likely candidates over random sampling.
* **Data-Driven:** Can be trained on millions of real-world credentials to learn the deep statistical patterns of human passwords creation.
* **Pre-trained Weights:** Includes robust models pre-trained on millions of real-world records from major PII breaches (e.g., Post Millennial, ClixSense) combined with the COMB dataset.

## Use Guide
> **Tip:** You can run this tool instantly without any local installation by opening our [Google Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tzohar/PassLLM/blob/main/PassLLM_Demo.ipynb), providing your target's PII, and simply executing each cell in order.

### Installation 
* **Python:** 3.10+
* **Password Guessing:** Runs on **Any GPU**, Nvidia or AMD. A standard CPU or Mac (M1/M2) is also sufficient to run the pre-trained model.
* **Training:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (RTX 3090/4090 recommended, Google Colab's free tier is often enough).

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/tzohar/PassLLM.git
   cd PassLLM

# 2. Install dependencies (Choose one)
   # Option A: Install from requirements (Recommended)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Option B: Manual install
   pip install torch torch-directml "transformers<5.0.0" peft datasets bitsandbytes accelerate gradio

```

### Configuration
   
Download the [trained weights](https://github.com/Tzohar/PassLLM/releases/download/v1.3.0/PassLLM-Qwen3-4B-v1.0.pth) (~126 MB) and place them in the `models/` directory.
*Alternatively, via terminal:*
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/Tzohar/PassLLM/releases/download/v1.3.0/PassLLM-Qwen3-4B-v1.0.pth -o models/PassLLM_LoRA_Weights.pth
```

   
Once installed and downloaded, adjust the settings in the WebUI or `src/config.py` to match your hardware.
| Hardware | OS | Device | 4-Bit Quantization | Torch DType | Inference Batch Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **NVIDIA** | Any | `cuda` | ✅ **On** (Recommended) | `bfloat16` | High (64+) |
| **AMD** | Windows | `dml` | ❌ **Off** | `float16` | Low (8-16) |
| **AMD (RDNA 3+)** | Linux/WSL | `cuda` | ❌ **Off** | `bfloat16` | Medium (64+) |
| **AMD (Older)** | Linux/WSL | `cuda` | ❌ **Off** | `float16` | Low (8-16) |
| **CPU** | Any | `cpu` | ❌ **Off** | `float32` | Low (1-4) |

> **Note (AMD on Linux/WSL):** DirectML (`dml`) is Windows-only. For AMD GPUs on Linux or WSL, you must install [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/) and [PyTorch for ROCm](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Once installed, set `DEVICE = "cuda"` as ROCm uses the CUDA API. 4-bit quantization (bitsandbytes) is not officially supported on ROCm. Newer AMD GPUs (RDNA 3 / RX 7000 series, MI200/MI300) have native `bfloat16` support, use it for significant speed improvements.

> **Tip:** Don't forget to customize the **Min/Max Password Length**, **Character Bias**, and **Epsilon** (search strictness) according to your specific target's needs!

### Password Guessing (Pre-Trained)

You can use the graphical interface (WebUI) or the command line to generate candidates.

#### Option A: WebUI (Recommended)

1. **Launch the Interface:**
```bash
python webui.py

```
2. **Generate:**
* Open the local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).
* **Select Model:** Choose the most recent model from the dropdown.
* **Enter PII:** Fill in the target's Name, Email, Birth Year, etc., into the form.
* **Click Generate:** The engine will stream ranked candidates in real-time.


#### Option B: Command Line (CLI)

Best for automation or headless servers.

1. **Create a Target File:**
Create a `target.jsonl` file (or use the existing one) in the main folder. You can include any field defined in `src/config.py`.
```json
{
  "name": "Johan P.", 
  "birth_year": "1966",
  "email": "johan66@gmail.com",
  "sister_pw": "Johan123"
}

```

2. **Run the Engine:**
```bash
python app.py --file target.jsonl --weights models/PassLLM-Qwen3-4B-v1.0.pth --fast 

```

* `--file`: Path to your target PII file.
* `--fast`: Uses optimized, shallow beam search (omit for full deep search).
* `--weights`: Path to your downloaded model weights (e.g., the .pth file).
* `--superfast`: Very quick but less accurate, mainly for testing.
### Training From Databases

To reproduce the paper's results or train on a new breach, you must provide a dataset of **PII-to-Password pairs**.

1.  **Prepare Your Dataset:**
    Create a file at `training/passllm_raw_data.jsonl`. Each line must be a valid JSON object containing a `pii` dictionary and the target `output` password.
    
    *Example `passllm_raw_data.jsonl`:*
    ```json
    {"pii": {"name": "Alice", "birth_year": "1990"}, "output": "Alice1990!"}
    {"pii": {"email": "bob@test.com", "sister_pw": "iloveyou"}, "output": "iloveyou2"}
    ```
    *Note: Ensure your keys (e.g., `first_name`, `email`) match the schema defined in `src/config.py`.*

2.  **Configure Parameters:**
    Edit `src/config.py` to match your hardware and dataset specifics:
    ```python
    # Hardware Settings
    TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE = 4           # Lower to 1 or 2 if hitting OOM on consumer GPUs
    GRAD_ACCUMULATION = 16   # Simulates larger batches (Effective Batch = 4 * 16 = 64)
    
    # Model Settings
    LORA_R = 16              # Rank dimension (Keep at 16 for standard reproduction)
    VOCAB_BIAS_DIGITS = -4.0 # Penalty strength for non-password patterns
    ```

3.  **Start Training:**
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
    This script automates the full pipeline:
    * **Freezes** the base model (Mistral/Qwen).
    * **Injects** Trainable LoRA adapters into Attention layers.
    * **Masks** the loss function so the model only learns to predict the *password*, not the PII.
    * **Saves** the lightweight adapter weights to `models/PassLLM_LoRA_Weights.pth`.
