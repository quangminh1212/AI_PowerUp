# Scholaris - Knowledge Graph QA Chatbot with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

> *From Latin "scholaris" - relating to schools and learning. A reasoning-powered chatbot that constructs explicit knowledge graphs from academic domains and uses chain-of-thought logic to answer questions with transparent, traceable explanations.*

## Overview

**Scholaris** is an advanced question-answering system that transcends traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by combining:

- **Structured Knowledge Graphs**: Symbolic representation of entities and relationships using Neo4j
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Step-by-step logical inference paths
- **Explainable AI**: Transparent reasoning traces with graph path visualization
- **Context Management**: Redis-based caching with intelligent summarization
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Graph-grounded responses backed by verified relationships

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Neo4j (Docker or local installation)
- Redis (Docker or local installation)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/danyalaltaff11555/Graph-Reasoning-Chatbot.git
cd scholaris

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and database URLs

# Initialize databases
python scripts/setup_databases.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from scholaris import ScholarisChatbot

# Initialize chatbot
bot = ScholarisChatbot()

# Ingest documents
bot.ingest_document("./papers/research_paper.pdf")

# Ask questions
response = bot.ask("How do transformers improve upon RNN models?")

print(response.answer)
print(response.reasoning_trace)
print(response.sources)
```

### Run API Server

```bash
python -m scholaris.api.main

# Access at http://localhost:8000
# API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Features

### 1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
- Automatic entity and relation extraction from documents
- Neo4j-based graph storage with efficient indexing
- Support for PDF, TXT, and Markdown files

### 2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
- Step-by-step reasoning traces
- Graph-grounded inference
- Confidence scoring for each step

### 3. **Explainable Answers**
- Transparent reasoning process
- Source citations with document references
- Graph path visualization

### 4. **Context Management**
- Redis-based conversation memory
- Automatic summarization at token limits
- Session persistence
