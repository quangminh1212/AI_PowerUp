## AI Powered Chatbots: A Collection of AI-Powered Chatbots

This repository features multiple demo chatbots, each designed to handle a specific domain or task. These bots leverage natural language understanding and conversational AI to provide automated solutions that mimic human interaction.

3. **HealthInsightBot**: operates within the healthcare domain, focusing on assisting users in understanding medical reports, conditions, or general healthcare inquiries.
3. _(Add more bots here as we build them)_

### Features
- **Chainlit Integration**: All bots are built using the Chainlit framework for streamlined development and deployment of conversational applications.
- **OpenAI Models**: The bots use OpenAI's GPT models to process natural language queries and respond in a human-like manner.
- **LangChain**: LangChain is used for documents loading, splitting and embedding into Pinecone
- **Pinecone**: Pinecone is used to keep embedded documents and used later as a context
- **HuggingFace**: For some bot, pre-trained models are integrated from HuggingFace in a specific domain
- **LiteralAI**: For observability and persistent messages/threads
- **Expandable**: The repository will continue to grow with additional AI bots that demonstrate practical applications of conversational AI in various domains.
