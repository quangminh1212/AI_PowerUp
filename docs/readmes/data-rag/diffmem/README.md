DiffMem is a lightweight, git-based memory backend for AI agents and conversational systems. It uses Markdown files for human-readable storage, Git for tracking temporal evolution through differentials, and a git-native retrieval agent that explores the repository via shell commands (`grep`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git blame`) to build targeted context. No vector databases, no embeddings, no BM25 — just git and an LLM.

At its core, DiffMem treats memory as a versioned repository: the "current state" of knowledge is stored in editable files, while historical changes are preserved in Git's commit graph. This separation allows agents to query and search against a compact, up-to-date surface without the overhead of historical data, while enabling deep dives into evolution when needed.

## Live in Production

DiffMem powers [Annabelle](https://withanna.io/), a simulated intelligence that maintains persistent memory across thousands of conversations on WhatsApp and Messenger.

In production, DiffMem enables Annabelle to:

- Reference details from conversations weeks ago
- Track the evolution of relationships over time
- Build structured understanding of each person she talks to
- Consolidate memories automatically as conversations grow

## Roadmap

- [ ] Indexing strategy from PoC needs to be made more robust, too memory intensive without need.
- [ ] Parametrized method for context caps on retrieval.
- [ ] Sometimes an entity will become a catch-all and the thing will insist in overloading it.
- [ ] Retrieval History so that we can spin up a "linked entities" model to support wikification
- [ ] PDF export.
- [ ] Research PoC: Visual retrieval for context compression.

## Why Git for AI Memory?

Traditional memory systems for AI agents often rely on databases, vector stores, or graph structures. These work well for certain scales but can become bloated or inefficient when dealing with long-term, evolving personal knowledge. DiffMem takes a different path by leveraging Git's strengths:

- **Current-State Focus**: Memory files store only the "now" view of information (e.g., current relationships, facts, or timelines). This reduces the surface area for queries and searches, making operations faster and more token-efficient in LLM contexts. Historical states are not loaded by default — they live in Git's history, accessible on-demand.

- **Differential Intelligence**: Git diffs and logs provide a natural way to track how memories evolve. Agents can ask "How has this fact changed over time?" without scanning entire histories, pulling only relevant commits.

- **Durability and Portability**: Plaintext Markdown ensures memories are human-readable and tool-agnostic. Git's distributed nature means your data is backup-friendly and not locked into proprietary formats.

- **Efficiency for Agents**: By separating "surface" (current files) from "depth" (git history), agents can be selective — load the now for quick responses, dive into diffs for analytical tasks. This keeps context windows lean while enabling rich temporal reasoning.

This approach shines for long-horizon AI systems where memories accumulate over years: it scales without sprawl, maintains auditability, and allows "smart forgetting" through pruning while preserving reconstructability.

## How It Works

DiffMem ships as a small FastAPI service. Key components:

- **Writer Agent** (`writer_agent`): Analyzes conversation transcripts, identifies/creates entities, and stages updates in Git's working tree. Commits are explicit and atomic.

- **Retrieval Agent** (`retrieval_agent`): A multi-turn LLM agent with a single `run(command="...")` tool that explores the memory repository via sandboxed shell commands. It reads `index.md`, probes git history for temporal patterns, and outputs a structured retrieval plan (file sections, git diffs, commit logs) that gets resolved into context.

- **API Layer** (`api.py` + `server.py`): HTTP endpoints for onboarding users, processing sessions, and retrieving context. Also importable as a Python library.

Each user gets an isolated **orphan branch** (`user/{user_id}`) inside a single local storage repo, checked out into a per-user worktree when active. Branches share no history with each other — it's strict isolation without per-user repos.

### Storage architecture

The service has two pluggable concerns:

- **Storage backend** — where the repo and worktrees live. Default is `local` (a mounted disk). This is a hard requirement of the retrieval agent, which shells out to `grep`/`git log` on a real directory.
- **Backup backend** — an *optional* bidirectional mirror. Options: `none` (default; rely on volume snapshots) or `github` (mirror user branches to a private GitHub repo you own). Pushes run on a scheduler and are never in the request hot path. Pulls happen at worktree mount time (first request per user after a restart), keeping the local volume in sync with any edits made from other machines.

This separation means self-hosters can run DiffMem with zero external dependencies, and users who want an offsite mirror can opt in with two env vars.

## Self-Hosting

DiffMem is designed to be deployed on a single small Linux box with a mounted volume. It's I/O-bound, not compute-bound — an e2-small / 1 vCPU VPS is plenty for thousands of conversations.

### One-click deploy with Coolify

[Coolify](https://coolify.io/) is an open-source, self-hostable Heroku/Vercel alternative. It's the easiest way to run DiffMem.

1. In Coolify, create a new **Docker Compose** resource.
2. Point it at this repository: `https://github.com/Growth-Kinetics/DiffMem`.
3. Set the compose file path to `docker-compose.yml` (default).
4. In the **Environment Variables** tab, set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to your key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
5. (Optional) Attach a domain — Coolify handles TLS via Let's Encrypt automatically.
6. Click **Deploy**.

Coolify will build the image, provision a named volume at `/data` (persists across deployments), run the healthcheck, and route traffic through its built-in Traefik reverse proxy. No TLS certs, no nginx configs, no open ports on the host.

DiffMem listens on `PORT`, defaulting to `8000`. If Coolify asks for the
service port or proxy target, use the same value you set for `PORT`.

Leave `REQUIRE_AUTH=false` (the default) if you're only calling DiffMem from another service on the same Coolify instance. Set `REQUIRE_AUTH=true` + `API_KEY=<long-random-string>` if you expose the domain publicly.

### Production deployment with Hatchet

For durable, observable, per-user-serialized task execution with [Hatchet](https://cloud.onhatchet.run)
on a Hetzner Cloud VPS, see **[docs/deployment-hatchet.md](docs/deployment-hatchet.md)**.

The production compose file is `deploy/docker-compose.hatchet.yml` — it runs two services
from the same image: `diffmem-api` (HTTP server) and `diffmem-worker` (Hatchet consumer).

### Plain Docker Compose

On any Linux box with Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Growth-Kinetics/DiffMem.git
cd DiffMem
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set OPENROUTER_API_KEY
docker compose up -d
```

The service listens on `http://localhost:8000`. All state lives in the `diffmem_data` named volume — back it up with `docker run --rm -v diffmem_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/diffmem-$(date +%F).tar.gz /data`.

### As a Python library

```python
from diffmem import DiffMemory

memory = DiffMemory("/path/to/worktree", "alex", "your-openrouter-key")
memory.process_and_commit_session("Had coffee with mom today...", "session-123")
context = memory.get_context([{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about mom"}])
```

### Configuration

Everything is configured via environment variables. Only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required; see `.env.example` for the full list with defaults.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | *(required)* | Your OpenRouter key |
| `DEFAULT_MODEL` | *(required)* | Shared LLM for writer, onboarding, and retrieval agents |
| `RETRIEVAL_MODEL` | *(unset)* | Optional retrieval-only model override; uses `DEFAULT_MODEL` when unset |
| `REQUIRE_AUTH` | `false` | Enable bearer-token auth (set true for public deployments) |
| `API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Shared bearer token when `REQUIRE_AUTH=true` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `*` | CORS origins, comma-separated |
| `BACKUP_BACKEND` | `none` | `none` or `github` |
| `BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `30` | Backup cadence (0 disables periodic backups) |
| `GITHUB_REPO_URL` | *(unset)* | Private repo for the `github` backup backend |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | *(unset)* | PAT with `repo` scope, for `github` backup |
| `STORAGE_PATH` | `/data/storage` | Where the central git repo lives |
| `WORKTREE_ROOT` | `/data/worktrees` | Where per-user worktrees are mounted |
| `DIFFMEM_ONTOLOGY` | `personal` | Entity taxonomy: `personal`, `corporate`, or absolute path to a custom ontology dir |
| `EXECUTOR` | `inline` | Task executor: `inline` (default) or `hatchet` (durable, observable) |
| `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` | *(unset)* | Hatchet Cloud API token; required when `EXECUTOR=hatchet` |
| `HATCHET_NAMESPACE` | `diffmem` | Namespace prefix for Hatchet workflow and worker names |
| `HATCHET_WORKER_SLOTS` | `10` | In-process concurrency slots per worker replica |

### Enabling GitHub backup (optional)

Want an offsite mirror without paying for external storage? Create a private GitHub repo (e.g. `yourname/my-diffmem-backup`), generate a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope, then set:

```
BACKUP_BACKEND=github
GITHUB_REPO_URL=https://github.com/yourname/my-diffmem-backup
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

**Cold-start restore**: on a brand-new deployment with an empty `/data` volume, DiffMem fetches any existing `user/*` branches from the remote so you don't start from scratch (useful for migrations and disaster recovery). Once the volume has user branches, startup-time restores are skipped — the mounted volume is the source of truth.

**Per-commit backup**: a post-commit hook fires a webhook that pushes the user's branch to GitHub in the background. Push failures never block the request — the periodic backup (`BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES`) catches up on the next tick.

**Remote pull at mount time**: when the service starts and a user's worktree is first accessed, DiffMem fetches their branch from GitHub and fast-forwards the local branch before serving any reads. This means edits made to memory files from another machine (pushed to GitHub) are visible as soon as the service restarts. Pull failures are non-fatal — the service continues with its local state.

**Credentials**: the token is passed to git via `GIT_ASKPASS` at call time, never written into `.git/config` on the volume.

## Migrating from earlier DiffMem versions

If you're upgrading from a pre-`0.4` deployment (where GitHub was the primary datastore), three behaviors change:

- **GitHub is now a backup, not a database.** The mounted `/data` volume is the source of truth. Snapshot it like any other stateful service.
- **Writes no longer block on GitHub.** `POST /process-and-commit` returns as soon as the local commit lands; the push runs in the background. Expect noticeably faster API responses.
- **Default storage paths moved** from `/app/storage` and `/app/worktrees` to `/data/storage` and `/data/worktrees`. Existing deployments that set these env vars explicitly are unaffected; deployments relying on the old defaults should either rebind the volume or set `STORAGE_PATH` / `WORKTREE_ROOT` to the old paths.

To preserve backwards compatibility, setting `GITHUB_REPO_URL` + `GITHUB_TOKEN` without an explicit `BACKUP_BACKEND` automatically enables the GitHub backup backend.

## API

Full interactive docs live at `http://<your-host>/docs` (Swagger UI) once the server is running.

The endpoints you'll actually use:

- `POST /memory/{user_id}/onboard` — create a new user
- `POST /memory/{user_id}/process-and-commit` — ingest a session transcript and commit
- `POST /memory/{user_id}/context` — retrieve context for a conversation
- `GET /memory/{user_id}/jobs/{job_id}` — poll a queued/running write or consolidate job

Write endpoints accept `?sync=true|false` to override the default response mode and an
optional `callback_url` in the body for webhook-style completion. Under `EXECUTOR=inline`
(default) the default is synchronous (block-until-done; preserves pre-executor contract).
Under `EXECUTOR=hatchet` the default is async (returns `{job_id, status}` in <500ms; poll
the `/jobs/{job_id}` endpoint or supply `callback_url`).

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memory/alex/onboard" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_info": "Alex is a software engineer from Seattle.", "session_id": "onboard-001"}'

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memory/alex/process-and-commit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"memory_input": "Had coffee with mom today. She mentioned her new job.", "session_id": "s-001"}'

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memory/alex/context" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about mom"}], "max_tokens": 15000}'
```

If `REQUIRE_AUTH=true`, add `-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"` to every request.

### Consolidation

DiffMem ships with an out-of-band **consolidator agent** that repairs three
failure modes the writer agent accumulates at scale: duplicate entities, an
overgrown user entity, and missing interlinking. It exposes four tools —
`dedupe`, `redistribute`, `link` (the default repair set), plus `reabsorb` (a
one-time v2 migration tool, excluded from the default run) — invokable
independently or chained.

Every consolidation commit is prefixed with `consolidate(reabsorb):`,
`consolidate(dedupe):`, `consolidate(redistribute):`, or `consolidate(link):`
so retrieval agents and humans can tell repair commits apart from
session-formation commits.

Endpoints:

- `POST /memory/{user_id}/consolidate` — run any subset of tools on demand.
- `POST /memory/{user_id}/process-commit-and-consolidate` — ingest a session,
  commit, then consolidate in one HTTP call.

Examples:

```bash
# Full chain (dedupe → redistribute → link), defaults.
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memory/alex/consolidate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# Just dedupe, with custom soft cap and link window for any tools that use them.
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memory/alex/consolidate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tools": ["dedupe"], "window": 5, "soft_cap_tokens": 24000}'

# Ingest a session, commit, then consolidate — single call.
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memory/alex/process-commit-and-consolidate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "memory_input": "Met Maya again today...",
    "session_id": "s-042",
    "consolidate_tools": ["dedupe", "link"]
  }'

# v2 migration: fold a legacy commitments corpus into owner Open Items (run once).
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memory/alex/consolidate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tools": ["reabsorb"]}'
```

What each tool does:

- **reabsorb** — *migration-only, deterministic (no LLM).* Folds a legacy
  `entities/commitments/` corpus into each commitment's owner entity as a
  `## Open Items` section (projects preferred → people → root user),
  canonicalizes status, then `git rm`s the source file. Idempotent: an empty or
  absent commitments folder produces zero commits. Required once when upgrading
  a corporate-ontology corpus from v1 to v2; excluded from the default run.
- **dedupe** — prefilters duplicate candidates (name similarity + overlapping
  `related_entities` / `hard_cues`), asks an LLM to confirm at high confidence,
  then merges the lower-strength file into the higher-strength one. The loser's
  filename stem is preserved as an `alias` in the survivor's SEMANTIC INDEX so
  the writer agent recognizes it on future sessions.
- **redistribute** — scans for entities exceeding `soft_cap_tokens` (default
  32 000, `len(content)//4` heuristic), then either (a) moves attributed
  sections to their real subject's file (e.g. content about a colleague
  living in the user entity → the colleague's `memories/people/*.md`) or
  (b) extracts orphan themes into new `memories/contexts/{slug}.md` files.
  Prefers smaller target entities (balancing rule).
- **link** — mines git log over the last `window` commits (default 3) for file
  co-occurrence, then asks an LLM to weave Obsidian-style wikilinks
  (`[[memories/people/maya|Maya]]`) inline in the prose. Idempotent: existing
  wikilinks are not duplicated. Opens the memory folder for navigation as an
  Obsidian vault.

A per-user lockfile (`<worktree>/.diffmem/consolidator.lock`) prevents
concurrent consolidator / writer runs.

## Repository layout

Each user's memory is organized as:

```
<worktree_root>/{user_id}/
├── {user_id}.md              # User's own profile
├── index.md                  # Auto-generated keyword index
├── memories/
│   ├── people/               # Per-person profiles
│   └── contexts/             # Thematic contexts (health, work, ...)
└── timeline/
    └── YYYY-MM.md            # Monthly timeline entries
```

See `repo_guide.md` in the repo root for the full memory schema (this file is copied into each user's worktree as `repo_guide.md` so the writer agent can reference it).

## Status

DiffMem is production software. It runs Annabelle's memory across thousands of conversations and has been through several iterations of hardening:

- **v0.5** — pluggable ontologies via `DIFFMEM_ONTOLOGY` env var. Two built-in profiles (`personal`, `corporate`); custom ontologies via absolute path; community contribution path in `ontologies/`. All agent scanning (writer, consolidator, retrieval) is now ontology-aware.
- **v0.4** — pluggable task executor (inline thread pool or Hatchet for durable/observable execution), per-user write serialization enforced server-side, out-of-band consolidation tools (dedupe, redistribute, link), bidirectional GitHub sync.
- **v0.3** — retrieval agent with sandboxed shell commands, git-native temporal reasoning, fallback to baseline on agent failure.
- **v0.2** — async write pipeline, thread pool to keep the event loop free, Railway/Docker hardening.

Known limitations:
- Write operations take 60–600s (LLM + git I/O). By default the HTTP response blocks until completion; pass `?sync=false` to get a `job_id` back immediately and poll `GET /memory/{user_id}/jobs/{job_id}`.
- Retrieval quality is model-dependent. GPT-4o-class models produce materially better entity linking and temporal reasoning than smaller models.
- Writer agent can default to updating the user entity on every session. Run the consolidator periodically (`POST /memory/{user_id}/consolidate`) to redistribute overgrown entities.
- Prompt tuning is ongoing — contributions welcome.

## Future Vision

DiffMem points to a future where AI memory is as versioned and collaborative as code:

- **Agent-Driven Pruning**: LLMs that "forget" low-strength memories by archiving to git branches, mimicking neural plasticity.
- **Collaborative Memories**: Multi-agent systems sharing repos, with merge requests for "memory reconciliation."
- **Temporal Agents**: Specialized models that query git logs to answer "how did I change?"
- **Multi-Provider Retrieval**: Swap between OpenRouter, Cerebras, or any OpenAI-compatible provider.
- **Open-Source Ecosystem**: Plugins for voice input, mobile sync, or integration with tools like Obsidian.

DiffMem is built and maintained by [Growth Kinetics](https://growthkinetics.com). We'd love collaborations, PRs, or honest feedback.
