# Fine-Tuning and Evaluating Vision LLMs for Multipage Document-to-JSON Conversion using Amazon SageMaker AI

This open-source project delivers a complete pipeline for converting multi-page documents (PDFs/images) into structured JSON using Vision LLMs on Amazon SageMaker. The solution leverages the [SWIFT Framework](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift) to fine-tune models specifically for document understanding tasks.

The repository features extensive evaluations through a comprehensive notebook collection that guides users through every step of the process - from dataset preparation to model deployment and performance assessment. The implementation has been validated using both the public Fatura2 invoice dataset and a private German invoice dataset with promising results.

- **Deployment Ready**: Includes batch inference and endpoint deployment solutions

## Implementation Workflow
The project is organized into seven detailed notebooks covering:

1. **Dataset conversion to Hugging Face format**: [01_optional_convert_fatura2_to_hf_dataset.ipynb](01_optional_convert_fatura2_to_hf_dataset.ipynb)
2. **Creation of Swift-compatible training data**: [02_create_custom_dataset_swift.ipynb](02_create_custom_dataset_swift.ipynb)
3. **Model fine-tuning on SageMaker**: [03_finetune_swift.ipynb](03_finetune_swift.ipynb)
4. **Batch inference for large document sets**: [04_run_batch_inference.ipynb](04_run_batch_inference.ipynb)
5. **Comprehensive model evaluation**: [05_evaluate_model.ipynb](05_evaluate_model.ipynb)
6. **Endpoint Deployment**: [06_deploy_model_endpoint.ipynb](06_deploy_model_endpoint.ipynb)
7. **Consume Model Endpoint**: [07_consume_model.ipynb](07_consume_model.ipynb)

## Prerequisite
* A Python 3.11 or Python 3.12 environment with Jupyter. We tested these notebooks in an Amazon SageMaker Studio Juypterlab environment version `3.2.0`. You can follow the [Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-updated-jl-user-guide-create-space.html) on how to create a Juypterlab Space.

## Evaluation Highlights

The repository includes a dedicated evaluation notebook (`05_evaluate_model.ipynb`) that performs:

- Field-level accuracy assessment for both keys and values
- Text quality measurement using multiple metrics
- Detailed visualization of JSON extraction results
- Comparative analysis between different model versions

The evaluation framework is particularly valuable as it allows for objective measurement of how well the models extract structured information from complex documents, with specialized metrics for different data types found in documents.

### Strutured JSON Evaluation with Character Edit Distance Heatmap

Let's look at some results when using Qwen2.5 VL 3B out of the box (vanilla), fine-tuning Qwen2.5 VL 3B, and fine-tuning Llama 3.2 11B Vision on the Fatura2 dataset. We run inference on 250 random samples of the Fatura2 dataset that are not used during fine-tuning. 

The graph below displays a comparative heatmap visualization of character edit distances for the three vision language models performing document-to-JSON extraction. Vanilla Qwen2.5 VL 3B model demonstrates considerable limitations. Without fine-tuning Qwen2.5 VL 3B only achieves decent results on extracting the TITLE and SELLER_NAME from the documents. Both the fine-tuned Qwen2.5 VL 3B (trained on 300 fatura2 examples) and Llama3.2 11B Vision (trained on 1k fatura2 examples) exhibit highly improved extraction capabilities, with predominant green regions representing exact matches across most attributes. These results suggest that fine-tuning vision language models can yield comparable high-quality results for document understanding and structured data extraction workflows. We expect to to perform especially well in domains where there is a high variation of

## Key Takeaways

* Fine-tuning vision LLMs allows to capture high document variation for document to JSON.
* Small models (3B, 7B, 11B parameters) perform extremely well. For example Qwen2.5 VL 3B trained on 300 samples achieves 98% accuracy on exact value extraction (exact match) for the Fatura2 dataset.
* We only spent limited time training larger models (> 70B parameters). Smaller models outperformed larger models. We think that larger models will have to be trained for longer and on more data.
* The following data preparation steps improved the model:
    * Fill missing JSON keys with null.
    * Ordering the keys in the JSON so that they are always in the same order.
    * We have a minimal prompt but did include the keys that the model is supposed to extract as a list in the prompt.
* JSON constrained decoding can make sure to generate valid JSON. On a private dataset, on which we also trained, JSON constrained decoding was helpful to reduce the model generating invalid JSON. After applying the data preparation steps on the Fatura2 dataset we do not observe any invalid JSON and do not see a need to use JSON constrained decoding for this dataset.
* Fine-tuning vision LLMs for document to JSON processing can be done cost effectively using Spot Instances, small models, and small datasets.

## Costs
Running the notebooks in this repository will occur cost, for example for model training and inference. The cost will depend on how big the model is you are fine-tuning, how large your dataset is, the hyperparameters configuration, and as a result the instance type selected and whether spot training is used. Here is a cost example from one of the models we fine-tuned in us-west-2 (Oregon) region:

|    | model                                                                                | pretty_name                                                                          |   task | spot? | instance type |  billable time (seconds)  |   on-demand hourly rate  |   total cost (USD) | notes |

|  1 | data/results/infer-json-Qwen-Qwen2-5-VL-3B-Instruct-2025-03-18-00-36-24-726/results  | Qwen2.5 VL 3B                                                                 |     batch inference |     spot |     ml.g6e.xlarge |       675 s | $1.861       | $0.35 | 250 documents processed. 


Keep in mind that the inference job takes additional time for downloading the dataset, downloading the model and merging the LoRA adapter with the base model. In the above example fine-tuned Qwen2.5 VL 3B on a ml.g6e.xlarge instance processes 1.16 documents per second. So  when batch processing more document at once the price should approach $0.45 per 1000 pages.
