# NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag

This NVIDIA RAG blueprint serves as a reference solution for a foundational Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

---

<h1>NVIDIA RAG Blueprint</h1>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs)
with real-time retrieval from trusted data sources.
It grounds AI responses in enterprise knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ensuring accuracy, compliance, and freshness.



## Overview

The NVIDIA RAG Blueprint is a reference solution and foundational starting point
for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with NVIDIA NIM microservices.
It enables enterprises to deliver natural language question answering grounded in their own data,
while meeting governance, latency, and scalability requirements.
Designed to be decomposable and configurable, the blueprint integrates GPU-accelerated components with NeMo Retriever models, Multimodal and Vision Language Models, and guardrailing services,
to provide an enterprise-ready framework.
With a pre-built reference UI, open-source code, and multiple deployment options — including local docker (with and without NVIDIA Hosted endpoints) and Kubernetes —
it serves as a flexible starting point that developers can adapt and extend to their specific needs.

For complex, multi-hop, or ambiguous questions, [**Agentic RAG**](docs/agentic-rag.md) adds a LangGraph plan-and-execute pipeline alongside the standard retrieve-then-generate chain — with scope discovery, parallel sub-tasks, synthesis, optional verification, and streaming stage events in the UI and API.

## Software Components

The RAG blueprint is built from the following complementary categories of software:


- **NVIDIA NIM microservices** – Deliver the core AI functionality. Large-scale inference (e.g. for example, Nemotron LLM models for response generation), retrieval and reranking models, and specialized extractors for text, tables, charts, and graphics. Optional NIMs extend these capabilities with OCR, content safety, topic control, and multimodal embeddings.

- **The integration and orchestration layer** – Acts as the glue that binds the system into a complete solution.

This modular design ensures efficient query processing, accurate retrieval of information, and easy customization.

 ### Integration and orchestration layer

- **RAG Orchestrator Server** – Coordinates interactions between the user, retrievers, vector database, and inference models, ensuring multi-turn and context-aware query handling. This is [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)-based.

- **Vector Database (accelerated with NVIDIA cuVS)** – Stores and searches embeddings at scale with GPU-accelerated indexing and retrieval for low-latency performance. The default is [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/vector-database). Another alternative is [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) (GPU-accelerated).

- **NeMo Retriever Extraction** – A high-performance ingestion microservice for parsing multimodal content. For more information about the ingestion pipeline, see [NeMo Retriever Extraction Overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/retriever/latest/extraction/overview/)

- **RAG User Interface (rag-frontend)** – A lightweight user interface that demonstrates end-to-end query, retrieval, and response workflows for developers and end users. For more information, refer to [RAG UI](docs/user-interface.md).

  </p>


## Workflow

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the workflow from the end-user perspective:

1. **Data Ingestion & Extraction Pipeline** – Multimodal enterprise documents (text, images, tables, charts, infographics, and audio) are ingested.

2. **User Query** – The user interacts with the system through the UI or APIs, submitting a question. An optional NeMo Guardrails module can filter or reshape the query for safety and compliance before it enters the retrieval pipeline.

3. **Query Processing** – The query is processed by the Query Processing service, which may also leverage reflection (an optional LLM step) to improve query understanding or reformulation for better retrieval results.

4. **Retrieval from Enterprise Data** – The processed query is converted into embeddings using NeMo Retriever Embedding and matched against enterprise data stored in a cuVS accelerated Vector Database (CuVS) and associated S3-compatible object store. Relevant results are identified based on similarity.

5. **Reranking for Precision** – An optional NeMo Retriever Reranker reorders the retrieved passages, ensuring the most relevant chunks are selected to ground the response.

6. **Response Generation** – The selected context is passed into the LLM inference service (e.g., Llama Nemotron models). An optional reflection step can further validate or refine the answer against the retrieved context. Guardrails may also be applied to enforce safety before delivery.

7. **User Response** – The generated, grounded response is sent back to the user interface, often with citations to retrieved documents for transparency.

## OpenShift Deployment

The RAG Blueprint has been validated on Red Hat OpenShift. OpenShift support is built into the Helm chart behind an `openshift.enabled` flag — Routes, SCC RoleBindings, and secret creation are handled declaratively.

```bash
helm upgrade --install rag -n <namespace> deploy/helm/nvidia-blueprint-rag \
  -f deploy/helm/nvidia-blueprint-rag/values-openshift.yaml \
  --set imagePullSecret.password="$NGC_API_KEY" \
  --set ngcApiSecret.password="$NGC_API_KEY"
```

For the full deployment runbook (prerequisites, NIM Operator setup, troubleshooting), see [`docs/deploy-helm-openshift.md`](docs/deploy-helm-openshift.md).
