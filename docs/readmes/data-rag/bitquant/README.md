# 🚀 BitQuant by OpenGradient

**BitQuant** is an open-source AI agent framework for building quantitative AI agents. It leverages specialized models for ML-powered analytics, trading, portfolio management, and more—all through a natural language interface. BitQuant exposes a REST API that turns user inputs like "What is the current risk profile on Bitcoin?" or "Optimize my portfolio for maximum risk-adjusted returns" into actionable insights.

### Agents

- **Analytics Agent**: Handles crypto analytics (price trends, risks, trending tokens, etc.)
- **Investment Agent**: Helps users select lending/AMM pools to maximize returns on Solana

> The router in `server.py` decides which agent to use for each user query.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
make venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install
```

## 💡 Sample Questions

Here are some example queries you can try with BitQuant:

### 🏦 DeFi Interactions
- Which protocols are delivering the best risk-adjusted yields right now?
- What's my potential impermanent loss risk if I provide liquidity to the USDC-SOL pool under different market scenarios?
- Calculate a comprehensive risk score for the top 5 Solana DeFi protocols based on TVL trends, code audits, and historical performance
- Compare the TVL growth, volatility, and stability metrics for Kamino vs Orca vs Raydium
- Which lending protocols have maintained the most stable yields over the past 3 months?

### 📊 Portfolio Analytics
- Can you analyze my portfolio's rolling volatility and identify which assets are contributing most to risk?
- How do the volatility trends of my top portfolio assets compare over the last 90 days?
- Show me the correlation between my holdings and provide insights on how to better diversify?
- What's my current portfolio risk assessment and how can I optimize for a better risk-return ratio?
- What's the maximum drawdown for my current portfolio and how does it compare to market benchmarks?

### 📈 Market Insights
- Based on current volatility trends and price patterns, what phase of the market cycle are we likely in?
- Based on historical data, what's the volatility forecast for BTC and ETH in the coming month?

## 🧑‍💻 Types of Agents You Can Build

BitQuant is designed to support a wide range of quantitative and DeFi-focused AI agents. Out of the box, the framework includes:

### 1. Analytics Agent
- **Purpose:** Provides deep analytics on portfolios, tokens, protocols, and market trends.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Analyze portfolio volatility, drawdowns, and diversification
  - Evaluate token and protocol risks
  - Track TVL, yield, and performance metrics
  - Identify trends and generate actionable market insights
- **Example Use Cases:**
  - "Analyze my portfolio’s risk profile."
  - "Show TVL trends for Solana DeFi protocols."

### 2. Investor Agent
- **Purpose:** Helps users find and act on yield opportunities and optimize DeFi strategies.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Recommend optimal pools and lending opportunities
  - Compare APRs, TVL, and risk across protocols
  - Guide users through liquidity provision, lending, and yield farming
- **Example Use Cases:**
  - "Which pools offer the best stablecoin yields?"
  - "Compare Kamino and Orca for USDC/SOL."

### 3. Custom Agents
- **Purpose:** The framework is extensible—developers can build agents for:
  - Automated trading strategies
  - On-chain data monitoring and alerting
  - NFT analytics
  - Cross-chain portfolio management
  - Any custom DeFi or analytics workflow

> **Tip:** Agents are modular and can be combined or extended to suit your specific use case. See the `agent/` directory and templates for examples and customization.
