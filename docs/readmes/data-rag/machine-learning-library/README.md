## Why this exists

The best material for learning machine learning is scattered across dozens of course pages, YouTube channels, arXiv PDFs, and personal blogs — each in a different format, none of it easy to search, embed, or feed to a model.

This repo pulls the highest-signal sources into **one place**, in **one consistent format**, with **clean metadata on every file**. The curation is the point: instead of an undifferentiated dump of arXiv or a noisy web scrape, this is a deliberately chosen reading list spanning the whole field — from "what is a neural network" all the way to sparse-attention and reasoning-model papers from 2025.

It's designed to be **used by both humans and machines**: read it directly to learn, or drop it into a vector database to build a retrieval-augmented tutor, fine-tune a domain model, or benchmark embeddings.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Total documents** | 923 |
| **Total size** | ~42M characters (~11M tokens) |
| **arXiv papers** | 391 (78 full-text + 313 recent abstract+metadata) |
| **Lecture transcripts** | 474 (across 14 courses/channels) |
| **Web articles** | 58 (canonical explainers) |
| **Topic tags** | 17-topic controlled vocabulary (+ level / medium / task / technique facets) |
| **Format** | Markdown + YAML frontmatter |
| **Coverage** | Intro fundamentals → frontier 2025–2026 research |

Every file begins with structured frontmatter (title, source, URL, authors, date, topics, **controlled `tags`**, `aliases`) so the whole corpus is trivially filterable and parseable — and navigable by topic (see [`atlas/`](atlas/) and [`atlas/TAGS.md`](atlas/TAGS.md)).

### Frontmatter format

Every document looks like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Attention Is All You Need"
source: "arxiv"
arxiv_id: "1706.03762"
url: "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7"
authors: ["Ashish Vaswani", "Noam Shazeer", ...]
published: "2017-06-12"
topics: ["transformer", "attention"]          # original free-form tags
aliases: ["Attention Is All You Need"]         # readable Obsidian wikilink targets
tags: [topic/transformers-attention, level/advanced, medium/paper, task/language, technique/attention]
---

## Abstract
...
## Full Text

```

`tags:` is a controlled, queryable vocabulary (topic / level / medium / task /
technique) layered on top of the original `topics:` — see [`atlas/TAGS.md`](atlas/TAGS.md).

## Use cases

This corpus is a building block. Some of the things it's good for:

1. **Retrieval-augmented ML tutor.** Embed the corpus, drop it in a vector DB, and build a Q&A assistant that answers ML questions grounded in real sources — and can cite the exact lecture or paper it drew from. No hallucinated references.

2. **Fine-tuning a domain model.** ~11M tokens of clean, on-topic ML text is a realistic dataset for continued-pretraining or instruction-tuning a small (1–7B) "ML explainer" model.

3. **Embeddings / retrieval benchmark.** A coherent, single-domain corpus is ideal for evaluating embedding models and retrieval pipelines on technical content.

4. **Synthesized study notes.** Use an LLM to compress multiple sources on one topic into a single cited note. `examples/self-attention-study-note.md` shows the output: a self-attention explainer assembled from the original paper, two blog posts, and a Karpathy lecture — every claim traced back to its source.

5. **Concept / citation graphs.** The frontmatter + cross-references make it straightforward to extract a graph of which papers and lectures explain which concepts.

6. **Personalized reading paths.** Filter by topic and source to generate an ordered learning path (e.g. "everything on diffusion models, easiest first").

7. **Offline reference library.** It's just Markdown — grep it, open it in Obsidian, read it on a plane.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ATOM00blue/machine-learning-library.git
cd machine-learning-library

# Browse the full index
less corpus/INDEX.md

# Everything is plain Markdown — search it however you like
grep -rl "flash attention" corpus/

# Filter by frontmatter, e.g. all 2024+ papers (with yq)
for f in corpus/papers/*.md; do
  yq -f extract '.published' "$f" | grep -q '^202[45]' && echo "$f"
done
```

Minimal RAG sketch (Python):

```python
import glob, frontmatter
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

docs = [frontmatter.load(p) for p in glob.glob("corpus/**/*.md", recursive=True)]
model = SentenceTransformer("BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")
embeddings = model.encode([d.content for d in docs])
# ... store in your vector DB of choice and query
```

A ready-to-run version of this lives in [`examples/rag_quickstart.py`](examples/rag_quickstart.py)
(`python examples/rag_quickstart.py --build`, then ask it questions).

## Open in Obsidian / connect your agent

This repo is also a ready-to-use **Obsidian vault** and an **agent-friendly
knowledge base** — pick whichever fits how you work:

**📓 Browse it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).** Open the cloned folder as a
vault — a bundled `.obsidian/` config sets up a topic-colored graph and sensible
defaults out of the box.
- **`atlas/Home.md`** is your start page; **`atlas/topics/`** has a hub per topic
  with a curated reading list and cross-links — all working with no plugins.
- Two **optional** community plugins make it shine; Obsidian will offer to enable
  them, or install from *Settings → Community plugins*:
  [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) (live auto-listed
  doc tables in each hub) and
  [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title)
  (graph/explorer nodes show titles instead of arXiv/video IDs).
- Everything degrades gracefully — the hubs, links, tags, and graph also render
  fine on GitHub and as plain Markdown with no plugins at all.

**🤖 Point your AI agent at it.** Choose one:
| You use… | Do this |
|---|---|
| Cursor / Codex / Copilot / Gemini CLI / Aider / Zed | Open the folder — they read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) automatically. |
| Claude Code | Open the folder — it reads [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md); a `/ml-library` skill is bundled. |
| Claude Desktop | Add a [Filesystem MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) pointed at this folder. |
| Obsidian + live read/write | Install the **Local REST API** plugin (built-in MCP server) and `claude mcp add` it. |
| Semantic search / RAG | Run [`examples/rag_quickstart.py`](examples/rag_quickstart.py). |

Your agent then answers ML questions grounded in these sources and **cites the
exact paper or lecture** — no hallucinated references.
