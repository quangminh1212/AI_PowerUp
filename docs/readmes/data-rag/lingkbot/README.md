LingkBot is a `ROS 2 Jazzy` robotics system integration project focused on embodied AI, semantic navigation, mobile manipulation, robot perception, and sim2real robustness. It is built around `LeoRover + myCobot 280 Pi + Intel RealSense D435 + RPLidar`, and connects `SLAM Toolbox`, `Cartographer`, `Nav2`, `RTAB-Map`, `YOLO-World`, `RGB-D 3D projection`, `MoveIt 2`, `MoveIt Task Constructor (MTC)`, `RAG memory pipeline`, `VLM orchestrator`, `ROS 2 Components`, and real-robot watchdog layers into one hierarchical embodied agent workflow.

This page is the English index for the `docs/showcase_posts` series. The goal is not to present a single flashy model demo, but to document a system-level path from classical robotics to a hierarchical embodied agent.

> **Open-source plan:** this project is planned to be open-sourced after September 2026. The articles will include more explanation about the open-source plan and scope.

**Keywords:** `Embodied AI`, `ROS 2`, `Nav2`, `SLAM Toolbox`, `Cartographer`, `RTAB-Map`, `YOLO-World`, `MoveIt 2`, `MoveIt Task Constructor`, `MTC`, `RAG`, `VLM Orchestrator`, `Semantic Navigation`, `Mobile Manipulation`, `LeoRover`, `myCobot`, `RealSense D435`, `RPLidar`, `Robot System Integration`, `Sim2Real`, `Behavior Tree`, `ROS 2 Components`

The core system tries to compress the following pipeline into one coherent robotics stack:

`simulation -> mapping/localization -> autonomous exploration -> visual recognition -> 3D target recovery -> robot arm grasping -> semantic mapping -> scene memory -> language navigation -> VLM orchestration -> real-robot safety layer`

## What This Project Actually Implements

### 1. Classical Robotics Foundation

- `slam_toolbox / cartographer` mapping
- `Nav2` localization and navigation

</p>

- frontier-based autonomous exploration with a custom `pink_ball_explorer`

### 2. Mobile Manipulation Closed Loop

- target discovery during patrol or exploration
- `YOLO + RGB-D + TF` to recover graspable 3D targets from 2D detections
- `myCobot + MoveIt2 + MTC` for top-down grasp execution
- a full state loop covering exploration, patrol, visual approach, human confirmation, grasp, and recovery

### 3. Three Semantic Navigation Routes

- `RTAB-Map` for 3D relocalization and kidnapped robot recovery

<p align="center">

  <img src="./assets/readme/03_kidnapped_robot_problem_demo_01.gif" alt="Kidnapped robot recovery demo using RTAB-Map relocalization" width="48%" />
</p>

- Route A: `YOLO-World` object-level online semantic mapping and navigation
- Route B: `LLM/VLM + keyframes + RAG` scene-memory navigation

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/readme/showcase_demo_04_scene_memory_navigation.gif" alt="Scene memory navigation demo with keyframes RAG and grounding" width="48%" />
</p>

- Route C: `VLM orchestrator` for online high-level semantic control handoff

### 4. Hierarchical Embodied Agent

- `VLM orchestrator` enters the online control loop instead of staying as a passive image-understanding tool
- the robot dynamically decides which module should take over the next physical action
- semantic reasoning, classical navigation, local visual servoing, and grasp execution are organized into one continuous embodied control chain

  <img src="./assets/readme/showcase_demo_07_vlm_orchestrator_v2.gif" alt="Embodied agent demo version 2 with hierarchical orchestration" width="48%" />
</p>

Further, `Component + Composition + lightweight BT mission flow` are used to split `Perception / Reasoning / Navigation / Alignment / Grasp / Supervision` into a more maintainable embodied architecture.

### 5. Side Extensions

- `ROSplat / 3DGS` as a parallel representation layer
- `Mediapipe Hands` for gesture-controlled robot arm interaction

### 6. Real Robot Demo

- real-hardware testing is currently focused on the minimum viable closed loop
- the verified path so far is: autonomous exploration mapping, navigation, and grasping
- this part is still being iterated carefully, but the real robot has already moved beyond bringup-only status

### 7. Epilogue

- this is not a new-algorithm paper project
- this is the evolution of a civilian-scale embodied robotics system
- it is also a case study in why full-stack robotics integration is rare

## What This Project Is Not

- not a single-paper novelty project
- not an industrial product
- not a fully mass-deployable real-robot closed-loop system

## What This Project Is

- a personal-scale robotics systems integration project
- an evolutionary path from classical robotics to embodied agents
- an attempt to compress mobile robots, robot arms, perception, semantics, language, and real-robot protection layers into one working system
