EraRAG is a novel hierarchical graph construction framework that supports dynamic updates through localized selective re-partitioning, enabling efficient and scalable retrieval with strong static accuracy and stable performance under corpus changes.

## 💫 Key Features

- **Accuracy**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse question types, including multi-hop and long-document QA tasks.
- **Efficiency**: Significantly reduces both graph construction time and token consumption compared to existing RAG baselines.
- **Incremental Updates**: Supports fast and efficient integration of new documents without requiring global tree reconstruction, enabling dynamic corpus adaptation.


## 🚀 Get Start

EraRAG and controled baselines are built on the unified framework proposed by [In-depth study of graphrag](https://github.com/JayLZhou/GraphRAG). Requirements.txt is included to help get you started. To run EraRAG, use the following command:
```
python main.py -opt <Method>.yaml -dataset_name <Datasetname> -external_tree <External tree path> -root <rootname> -query <wether to query>
```

On default, EraRAG will treat the input corpus as new corpus and enforce a global reconstruction. To make a insertion to a existing tree, set Dynamic.yaml key parameters as follows.

```
force: False
add: True
```


<!-- If you want to try reproducing the baseline methods, simply run:

```
bash run_baseline.sh
```

## 🧰 Experimental Settings

We have incorporated several baseline methods and benchmark datasets:

## ⚙️ Experimental Results

Our proposed EraRAG framework achieves significant retrieval performance against state of the art graph-based RAG frameworks.

Thanks to the proposed selective reconstruction mechanism, EraRAG is able to perform fast insertions on evolving corpora, surpassing benchmarks on time and token cost reduction.
