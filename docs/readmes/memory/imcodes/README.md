**The IM for agents. Shared memory, OpenSpec Auto Deliver, managed MCP tools, supervised execution, and cross-agent audit across AI providers.**

> Two heads are better than one.<br>
> But minds in concert don't answer fate, they author it.<br>
> — IM.codes

IM.codes gives coding agents one shared memory layer and one managed MCP tool surface across providers. It turns completed work into reusable context, then injects or recalls the right history in future sessions across [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), GitHub Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com), [Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-agent), and more — with terminal access, file browsing, git views, localhost preview, notifications, multi-agent workflows, and native streaming output for transport-backed agents. For spec-driven work, OpenSpec Auto Deliver can take a change from proposal/spec audit through implementation, validation hints, Team audit/rework, automatic module scoring, and final quality gates. Session sharing also supports pair or multi-person collaborative coding around live agent sessions. Built-in Auto supervision can judge completed turns, continue work autonomously, and optionally run an audit/rework loop before handing control back. Team discussion lets multiple models review and audit each other's plans and implementations — an effective way to reduce single-model misses, blind spots, and biases.

Supports iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Also available as a [web app](https://app.im.codes).

## Why

When you leave your desk, most coding-agent workflows fall apart. The agent is still running in a terminal, but continuing the work usually means SSH, tmux attach, remote desktop hacks, or waiting until you're back at your laptop.

That reach problem is only one half of it. Complex coding-agent work also needs steadier judgment: a single model can fall into familiar patterns, miss issues, or produce unstable answers on hard tasks. Switching providers can help, but without shared context it can also lose the thread.

[IM.codes](https://im.codes) is built around both needs. It keeps sessions within reach from mobile or web: open the terminal, inspect files and git changes, preview localhost from another device, get notified when work finishes, invite another person into the same session or server, and keep multiple agents moving on your own infrastructure. It also pairs [Shared Agent Context & Memory](#shared-agent-context--memory) with [Multi-Agent Discussions & Cross-Provider Audit](#multi-agent-discussions--cross-provider-audit): durable recall comes from summarized completed work, while Team discussion is structured cross-model review before code lands. It does not make output perfect, but it reduces single-model blind spots and helps complex work converge with more review.

It is not another AI IDE or a generic remote terminal. It is the messaging, memory, and review layer around terminal-based coding agents.

## OpenSpec Auto Deliver

For OpenSpec-based changes, Auto Deliver turns a change folder into an end-to-end supervised delivery run: proposal/spec review, implementation, validation, Team audit, automatic module scoring, rework gates, and a visible final handoff.

- **One-click change pipeline.** Launch from an OpenSpec change on a transport-backed coding session. IM.codes resolves the owning session, locks the Team lane to prevent conflicting runs, reads `tasks.md`, and keeps a live run projection in the UI.
- **Spec audit before implementation.** Optional proposal/spec audit-repair uses the normal Team flow (default `audit>review>plan`) and reads an authoritative JSON result instead of trusting chat summaries.
- **Task-driven implementation loop.** The daemon sends focused implementation prompts back into the same session, works only on that OpenSpec change, tracks checked/unchecked tasks, and surfaces safe validation command candidates discovered from project manifests.
- **Automatic module scoring.** Every audit produces structured scores for `spec`, `tasks`, `implementation`, `tests`, and `risk`, with evidence and summaries visible in the run details instead of buried in chat text.
- **Implementation audit and rework gates.** The final scored verdict — `PASS`, `REWORK`, or `BLOCKED` — decides whether the run can pass, should repair while limits allow, or needs a human decision.
- **Presets for delivery depth.** `fast`, `standard`, `strict`, and `deep` tune spec-audit rounds, implementation-audit rounds, max implementation prompts, and elapsed-time limits.
- **Fail-closed and human-owned.** Auto Deliver asks for human input on invalid audit output, time/prompt limits, manual interference, incompatible Team state, or unreadable tasks. It does **not** stage, commit, or push code; the user stays the final release owner.

## Collaborative Coding

Share a tab, sub-session, or whole source server with another user. Use `viewer` for read-only review or `participant` when a teammate should send prompts into the covered sessions. Shared messages carry actor labels, and access can be downgraded or revoked from the UI.

## Shared Agent Context & Memory

IM.codes continuously turns completed agent work into reusable memory and feeds that context back into future sessions.

- **Problem → solution memory, not log spam.** Only final `assistant.text` outputs are materialized. Streaming deltas, tool calls, and intermediate noise are excluded.
- **Personal memory with optional cloud sync.** Raw and processed memory always stay local; processed summaries can optionally sync to a user-scoped cloud pool shared across your devices.
- **Enterprise shared context.** Teams can publish reusable memory into workspace/project scopes, inspect it in the UI, query it, and see stats instead of treating context as hidden prompt text. This part is still under active development and has not been fully production-tested yet.
- **Multilingual recall.** Local semantic search and server-side pgvector recall use multilingual embeddings, so related fixes can be found across English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Russian, and mixed-language repos.
- **Automatic injection where it matters.** Relevant past work is injected both per-message and at session startup, with timeline cards that show what was recalled, why, the relevance score, recall count, and last-used time.
- **User-visible inspection and control.** Shared Context UI separates raw events, processed summaries, cloud memory, and enterprise memory, with query, preview, archive/restore, and processing configuration controls.

## Managed MCP Tools

IM.codes exposes a daemon-managed stdio MCP server to supported SDK-backed providers. Agents get one runtime-scoped tool surface for memory, agent-to-agent messaging, and scheduled follow-ups, without raw auth tokens or ad hoc shell commands.

- **Memory recall and provenance.** `search_memory` searches the caller-bound memory namespace for prior work, project history, decisions, preferences, bugs, commits, deployments, and previously discussed context. `list_memory_summaries` retrieves recent compact summaries without a query. Results include compact refs plus `projectionId` values; `get_memory_sources` expands a relevant hit into provenance snippets when the model needs exact prior instructions, bug details, commit/deployment context, or source evidence.
- **Memory writes.** `save_observation` stores useful facts, decisions, or implementation notes as user-private memory candidates; `save_preference` stores stable user preferences through the explicit preference path.
- **Agent messaging.** `send_list_targets` lists sibling sessions in the current project, and `send_message` sends scoped messages, optional file path references, reply requests, or broadcasts through the same guarded `imcodes send` pipeline.
- **Cron scheduling.** `cron_create`, `cron_list`, `cron_update`, and `cron_delete` manage future structured sends for reminders, recurring checks, delegated reviews, or scheduled Team follow-ups, with target/session/project fields and optional expiration/timezone data.
- **Runtime-bound identity and safety.** Tool calls are bound to the current IM.codes session, project, user, and server at runtime. Agents cannot forge namespace, user, server, token, or routing fields; memory, Send, and Cron all remain behind their underlying feature gates plus MCP kill switches.
- **Operational visibility.** The Shared Context UI reports MCP readiness per managed provider, tool-family gate state, degraded reasons, update time, and recent daemon-redacted tool calls so you can tell whether the model really has Memory, Send, and Cron available.

## Supervised Execution & Auto Audit

IM.codes can drive supported agent sessions turn by turn — a supervisor with your own instructions evaluates each completed turn at the idle boundary and decides to auto-continue, hand back, or trigger an audit loop, instead of you typing "continue" every round.

- **Per-session Auto modes.** Configure `off`, `supervised`, or `supervised_audit` per session instead of forcing one policy everywhere.
- **Completion checks at the idle boundary.** When a turn finishes, IM.codes can classify it as `complete`, `continue`, or `ask_human`, then dispatch the next continue prompt inside the same session.
- **Fail-closed automation.** Auto supervision stays visible in the timeline/footer, uses structured decisions, and returns control to you on timeout, invalid output, or bad config instead of silently guessing.
- **Optional audit → rework loop.** In `supervised_audit`, a completed turn can automatically enter an audit pipeline and send a rework brief back into the same session before control returns.
- **Global defaults seed new sessions.** Set your default supervisor backend, model, and timeout once. New `supervised` / `supervised_audit` sessions snapshot them at enable time, and each session can still override backend/model/timeout and audit mode individually.
- **Two-layer custom supervision instructions.** Keep a global supervision persona alongside a per-session addition. By default the two are concatenated (`global`, blank line, then `session`); tick the session's **Override global** checkbox to ignore the global value for that one session. Unlike backend/model/timeout, the global value is re-read on every dispatch, so editing it takes effect on already-enabled sessions without a re-enable.
- **Built for real IM.codes workflows.** Auto supervision understands OpenSpec work, Team discussion/review flows, and `imcodes send`-style cross-agent coordination as valid agent actions, not immediate reasons to stop for a human.

## Features

### Private Aliases

Save owner-scoped reusable text snippets and insert them from the composer by typing `;` or selecting a `;;(name)` marker. The message keeps the marker visible while IM.codes resolves and delivers the value out of band. Agents can create, search, edit, and resolve aliases through managed MCP tools; bulk listings expose metadata only, so one call cannot dump every stored value into model context.

### Controlled Nodes

Enroll another machine as a restricted controlled node without turning it into a full IM.codes source server. Type `^` to autocomplete a target or insert `^^(name)` directly, then authorized agents can run scoped remote commands, transfer individual files, or invoke typed Computer Use tools on that node. Execution remains owner-gated and revocable, controlled nodes stay out of normal server/session lists, and each enrolled machine receives independent credentials. Download links expire, but a newly downloaded installer can be kept and reused to enroll multiple machines.

### Computer Use & Browser Automation

Supported SDK agents can control desktop apps through typed Computer Use tools. The cross-platform desktop-app path integrates [Open Computer Use](https://github.com/iFurySt/open-codex-computer-use) by Leo ([iFurySt](https://github.com/iFurySt)), licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/iFurySt/open-codex-computer-use/blob/main/LICENSE); credit goes to that project for this integrated capability.

Browser automation is a separate IM.codes feature built directly on Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP): agents can open, inspect, navigate, click, fill, and evaluate pages, returning structured text by default and an optional screenshot only when requested. The managed browser exposes a loopback-only CDP endpoint so local Python or Node scripts can attach to the same live instance for complex work without launching another browser.

### Remote Terminal

Full terminal access to your agent sessions from any browser — no SSH, no VPN, no port forwarding. Switch between raw terminal mode (the native CLI experience) and a structured chat view with parsed tool calls, thinking blocks, and streaming output. Real-time PTY streaming at 12fps with zero message limits.

### File Browser & Git Changes

Browse project files with a tree view. Upload files, images, and photos from any device — download files directly from the server. Changes tab shows git status with per-file `+additions`/`-deletions` line counts in color. Click a file to open a floating preview window with syntax highlighting, diff view, rendered HTML quick preview, and auto-refresh every 5s. Chat-rendered local file links get quick actions too: HTML files can open a safe rendered preview, and local image paths render inline thumbnails that expand in a floating lightbox. Pin the file browser to the sidebar — it follows the active tab's project directory automatically.

### Local Web Preview

Preview your local dev server from any device — phone, tablet, or remote browser — without deploying. The daemon proxies `localhost` traffic through a secure WebSocket tunnel to the server. HTML rewriting and a runtime patch handle URL remapping so links, fetch, and WebSocket connections just work. Supports HMR/hot-reload via WebSocket tunneling. No public URLs, no third-party tunnels — traffic stays within your IM.codes server.

### Mobile, Watch & Notifications

Full mobile support with biometric auth and push notifications. Shell sessions allow interactive keyboard input on mobile (SSH-like). Sub-session preview cards always show latest messages. Toast notifications navigate directly to the relevant session. Apple Watch support adds quick session monitoring, unread counts, and quick replies from the wrist.

### OpenSpec Auto Deliver

Run a spec-driven change through a structured delivery pipeline: proposal/spec audit, implementation prompts, manifest-aware validation hints, Team audit/rework, automatic module scores for spec/tasks/implementation/tests/risk, and a fail-closed handoff. The run bar shows progress across stages, task counts, audit rounds, evidence, and terminal reasons so the automation remains inspectable instead of becoming another hidden background agent.

### Collaborative Coding

Share a live session for pair programming, or invite more people into a scoped server workspace with viewer/participant roles.

### Supervised Task Automation

Auto supervision adds turn-level control for supported transport-backed agents. Instead of blindly continuing forever, IM.codes evaluates the latest completed turn and decides whether the task looks done, should keep going, or should come back to you. For higher-assurance work, `supervised_audit` can automatically trigger an audit/rework loop before the session is considered finished.

Auto supervision splits configuration into two layers. Backend, model, and timeout are **snapshot-frozen** at the moment you enable Auto on a session, so editing the global defaults later never surprises an already-running session. Custom supervision instructions work differently: a **global persona** is paired with the session's own free text and — by default — both are concatenated into the prompt sent to the supervisor. Tick the session's **Override global** checkbox to have that session ignore the global persona entirely. The global persona is re-read on every turn, so when you update it every already-enabled session picks it up on the next dispatch without needing a re-enable. Auto is also aware of IM.codes-native workflows such as OpenSpec changes, Team discussions, and `imcodes send`, so those actions count as legitimate next steps instead of accidental "ask human" triggers.

### Multi-Agent Discussions & Cross-Provider Audit

Single-model output shouldn't be trusted blindly. Team discussions let multiple agents — across different providers and thinking styles — collaborate on the same codebase before a single line is written. Each round follows a customizable multi-phase pipeline where every agent reads all prior contributions and builds on them. Different models catch different classes of issues: one spots a race condition, another flags a missing migration, a third questions the API design. This cross-provider scrutiny catches problems a single model often misses before implementation, reducing rework cycles.

Built-in modes include `audit` (structured audit → review → plan pipeline), `review`, `discuss`, and `brainstorm` — or define your own phase sequence. Ring progress indicator shows round/hop completion in the sidebar. Works across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Qwen, including sandboxed agents. Configure participants, round counts, modes, and per-session Team settings via `@@all(config)` or the UI.

### Streaming Transport Agents

Native streaming output support for transport-backed agents like [Claude Code SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript), [Codex SDK](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/sdk/typescript), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com), and [Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-agent). These agents connect via network protocols or local SDKs instead of terminal scraping, delivering structured event streams with real-time delta updates, tool call tracking, and session restore.

> **Note on OpenClaw:** `imcodes connect openclaw` has only been tested on macOS so far.

### Managed MCP Tool Surface

Supported SDK providers can receive the ten-tool IM.codes-managed MCP surface automatically: memory search/source lookup, observation and preference capture, scoped Send, and Cron scheduling. MCP status is reported per provider in the UI, with ready/degraded states so you can tell whether Memory, Send, and Cron tools are actually available to that model.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Agents can message each other directly using `imcodes send`. An agent running in one session can ask a sibling to review code, run tests, or coordinate on a task — no user intervention needed. Target resolution by label, session name, or agent type. `--reply` flag instructs the target to send its response back automatically. Built-in circuit breakers prevent abuse (depth limit, rate limiting, broadcast cap).

The same flow is available to SDK-backed agents through MCP: `send_list_targets` discovers valid sibling targets, and `send_message` sends scoped text, file references, reply requests, or broadcasts without exposing raw routing credentials.

```bash
imcodes send "Plan" "review the changes in src/api.ts"
imcodes send "Cx" "run tests" --reply
imcodes send --all "migration complete, check your end"
```

Beyond agent-to-agent chat, you can use `script` sessions to build custom automation. A Python script running in a script session can call `imcodes send` to trigger agents based on any external event:

```python
# monitor.py — watch a log file, trigger agent when errors appear
import subprocess, time

while True:
    with open("/var/log/app.log") as f:
        for line in f:
            if "ERROR" in line:
                subprocess.run([
                    "imcodes", "send", "Claude",
                    f"Fix this error and write the patch to /tmp/fix.patch:\n{line}"
                ])
    time.sleep(30)
```

```bash
# Webhook → agent: GitHub webhook handler triggers code review
curl -X POST https://your-server/webhook -d '{"pr": 42}' \
  && imcodes send "Gemini" "review PR #42, write summary to /tmp/review.md"

# CI → agent: post-build trigger
imcodes send "Claude" "tests failed on main, check CI log at /tmp/ci.log and fix" --reply
```

Use cases: log monitoring → auto-fix, webhook-triggered code review, CI failure auto-diagnosis, scheduled data pipeline checks, custom approval workflows with output written to specific files for human review.
### @ Picker — Smart Agent & File Selection

Type `@` to search project files, `@@` to select agents for Team dispatch. `@@all(config)` sends to all configured agents with saved per-session Team settings (mode, rounds, participants). Custom round counts via `@@all+`. The picker integrates with the structured WS routing — daemon handles all expansion, frontend stays clean.

### Multi-Server, Multi-Session Management

Connect multiple dev machines to one dashboard. Each machine runs a lightweight daemon that manages local agent sessions via tmux. See all servers and sessions at a glance — start, stop, restart, or switch between them instantly. Sub-sessions let you spawn additional agents from within a running session for parallel tasks. Draggable tabs with pin support and right-click context menus.

### Discord-Style Sidebar

Server icon bar for instant multi-server switching. Hierarchical session tree with collapsible sub-sessions, unread message badges, and idle flash animation when agents finish tasks. Pin any floating window (file browser, repository, sub-session chat) to the sidebar for persistent access. Language switcher and build info at the bottom.

### Pinnable Panels

Drag any floating window to the sidebar to pin it as a persistent panel. Supports file browser, repository page, sub-session chat, and terminal views. Panels are resizable, server-synced (cross-device), and auto-recover on reconnect. Generic registry — new panel types register in one file.

### Repository Dashboard

View issues, pull requests, branches, commits, and CI/CD runs directly in the app. Silent background refresh — no more pull-to-refresh jitter. CI status auto-polls (10s when running, 15s otherwise). Pin the repository page to the sidebar for always-on visibility.

### Scheduled Tasks (Cron)

Automate recurring agent workflows with cron-style scheduling. Create scheduled tasks that send commands to specific sessions or trigger multi-agent Team discussions on a timetable. Visual cron picker for common intervals, timezone-aware scheduling, and manual "Run Now" for testing. Execution history with expandable result detail — click any record to navigate to the target session and quote the result for follow-up. Cross-job execution list with Latest/All modes and multi-server filtering.

SDK-backed agents can manage the same scheduler through MCP with `cron_create`, `cron_list`, `cron_update`, and `cron_delete`, creating structured sends for reminders, recurring checks, delegated reviews, or follow-ups while staying bound to the current project/session identity.

### Cross-Device Sync

Tab order, pinned tabs, and pinned sidebar panels sync across devices via the server preferences API. Write-through cache pattern: localStorage for instant render, debounced server PUT for cross-device consistency. Timestamped payloads for conflict resolution. Device-specific state (sidebar width, panel heights, view mode) stays local.

### Internationalization

7 languages: English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, Español, Русский, 日本語, 한국어. Language switcher in the sidebar footer. All user-visible strings use i18n keys.

### OTA Updates

Daemon self-upgrades via npm. Trigger from the web UI for one device or all devices at once.

## What IM.codes is not

- Not another AI IDE
- Not just a chat wrapper
- Not just a remote terminal client
- Not a replacement for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, or Qwen
- It is the messaging/control layer around them

## Architecture

```
You (browser / mobile)
        ↓ WebSocket
Server (self-hosted)
        ↓ WebSocket
Daemon (your machine)
        ↓ tmux / transport / managed MCP
AI Agents (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI / OpenClaw)
        ↔ imcodes send (agent-to-agent)
```

The daemon runs on your dev machine and manages process-backed agent sessions through tmux or transport-backed sessions through network protocols / local SDKs (for example Claude Code SDK, Codex SDK, OpenClaw gateway, and Qwen). It also owns the managed MCP server that exposes runtime-scoped memory, Send, and Cron tools to supported SDK providers. Agents can communicate with each other via `imcodes send`. The server relays connections between your devices and the daemon. Everything stays on your infrastructure.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g imcodes
```

## Quick Start

> **Self-hosting is strongly recommended.** The shared instance at `app.im.codes` is for testing only — it comes with no uptime guarantees, may be rate-limited, and could be targeted. This is a personal project with no commercial support. For anything beyond evaluation, deploy the server on your own infrastructure.

Use [app.im.codes](https://app.im.codes) for evaluation, or self-host for anything real.

```bash
imcodes bind https://app.im.codes/bind/<api-key>
```

This binds your machine, starts the daemon, registers it as a system service, and brings the machine into the web/mobile dashboard.

### OpenClaw Connect

If OpenClaw is running locally, connect IM.codes to the OpenClaw gateway on the daemon machine:

```bash
imcodes connect openclaw
```

What this does:

- connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` by default
- reuses the OpenClaw gateway token automatically from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- syncs OpenClaw sessions and child sessions into IM.codes so they appear as transport-backed sessions/sub-sessions
- saves the IM.codes-side connection config to `~/.imcodes/openclaw.json`
- restarts the daemon so OpenClaw transport sessions can reconnect automatically

Common variants:

```bash
imcodes connect openclaw --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=... imcodes connect openclaw
imcodes connect openclaw --url wss://gateway.example.com
```

Notes:

- remote non-TLS `ws://` URLs require `--insecure`
- use `imcodes disconnect openclaw` to remove the saved config and drop the connection
- this flow has only been tested on macOS

## Self-Host

### One-Command Setup

Deploy server + daemon on a single machine. Requires Docker and a domain with DNS pointing to the server.

```bash
npm install -g imcodes
mkdir imcodes && cd imcodes
imcodes setup --domain imc.example.com
```

This generates all config, starts PostgreSQL + server + Caddy with automatic HTTPS, creates the admin account, and binds the local daemon — all in one step. Credentials are printed at the end.

To connect additional machines:

```bash
npm install -g imcodes
imcodes bind https://imc.example.com/bind/<api-key>
```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/im4codes/imcodes.git && cd imcodes
./gen-env.sh imc.example.com        # generates .env with random secrets, prints admin password
docker compose up -d
```

The generated `docker-compose.yml` already uses `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` for PostgreSQL.

Login at `https://your-domain` with `admin` and the printed password. Bind your dev machine with `imcodes bind`.

## Windows (experimental)

Windows is natively supported via [ConPTY](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/) (built-in on Windows 10+). No WSL required.

### Install & Bind (Windows)

```cmd
npm install -g imcodes
imcodes bind https://app.im.codes/bind/<api-key>
```

### Upgrade (Windows)

```cmd
imcodes upgrade
```

Or upgrade remotely from the web dashboard (sends upgrade command to the daemon).

### Troubleshooting (Windows)

If the daemon stops after an auto-upgrade, regenerate the launch chain:

```cmd
imcodes repair-watchdog
```

This rewrites the watchdog script and scheduled task with the current Node.js and imcodes paths. Needed after Node.js version switches (nvm, fnm) or if the daemon won't restart after upgrade.

If `imcodes` is "not recognized as internal or external command" after upgrade, the npm global directory may not be on your PATH. Fix it:

```cmd
npm prefix -g
```

Copy the output path and add it to your PATH:

```cmd
setx PATH "<npm-prefix-path>;%PATH%"
```

Then open a **new** terminal window.

Check the daemon watchdog log for errors:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.imcodes\watchdog.log

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux (tested on both)
- **Windows (experimental)**: Native support via ConPTY (built-in on Windows 10+). Just `npm install -g imcodes` — no extra software needed. WSL also works.
- Node.js >= 22
- Terminal multiplexer: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (Linux/macOS). Windows uses ConPTY (auto-detected, built-in).
- At least one AI coding agent: [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (CLI or SDK), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) (CLI or SDK), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com), or [Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-agent)

## About

This is a personal project. I haven't written any code myself — it was built almost entirely by [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), with significant contributions from [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) and [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).
