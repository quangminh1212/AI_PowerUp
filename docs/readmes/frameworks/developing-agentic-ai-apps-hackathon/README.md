## Introduction

Welcome to this hands‑on hackathon for building Agentic AI applications. You’ll design, build, secure, observe, orchestrate, and scale intelligent AI solutions on Azure.

This hackathon provides a deep‑dive experience for developers building Agentic AI applications.

The hackathon is a collaborative learning experience, structured as a set of challenges to practice technical skills. By participating, you will gain a clear understanding of the capabilities of Agentic AI applications.

Over a progressive series of challenges, you will deepen your understanding of Agentic architectures and Azure services. Each challenge introduces new concepts and capabilities, building on previous outcomes to reinforce architectural patterns while expanding your knowledge of Azure and Agentic technologies.

This workshop typically requires two full days to complete, depending on participants' skill levels. It is a collaborative activity where participants form teams of 3–5 to work through each challenge.

All technical tracks are offered in both C# and Python, allowing you to choose your preferred language for each challenge. The repository includes fully guided student instructions and coach solutions for reference.

## Learning Objectives
