[SemaClaw](https://github.com/midea-ai/SemaClaw) is a general-purpose engineering harness for building personal AI agents. It is built on top of a reusable agent runtime ([sema-code-core](https://github.com/midea-ai/sema-code-core)) and provides the surrounding machinery — permissions, memory, scheduling, multi-agent orchestration, channel adapters, and a Web UI — that turns a raw runtime into a usable personal AI system. It is also a reference implementation and starting point for the community to evaluate and improve on the engineering decisions behind it.

*SemaClaw analyzed its own source code and generated the intro video above — powered by [frontend-slides](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides) and [remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion) skills (DeepSeek-Chat for all preceding steps, Claude Sonnet 4.6 for Remotion animation coding).* [Watch full demo video](https://midea-ai.github.io/SemaClaw/assets/SemaClaw-demo.mp4)

## Highlights

- **Three-layer context management** — Unifies working context, long-term memory retrieval, and per-agent persona partitioning into a single coherent model.
- **Human-in-the-Loop permissions** — `PermissionBridge` is a native harness primitive supporting both explicit user authorization for high-risk tool actions and agent-initiated clarification requests.
- **Four-layer plugin architecture** — MCP tools, subagents, skills, and hooks — each anchored to a distinct engineering concern, forming a principled extension surface.
- **Plugin Marketplace** — Install third-party plugin bundles from any git repo or local directory. Each plugin can package skills, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers together. Plugins are default-off and per-plugin toggled from the Web UI; multiple sources can be added with priority ordering.
- **DAG Teams** — A two-stage hybrid orchestration framework combining LLM-based dynamic task decomposition with deterministic DAG execution. Supports mixed teams of persistent and virtual agents, with 5 built-in virtual subagents ready to use out of the box.
- **Reusable Workflows** — Codify repeatable routines as declarative DAG definitions (Markdown + YAML) that mix agent steps (isolated persona sessions) with deterministic script steps. Parameterized inputs, `{{…}}` templating with auto-inferred dependencies, a two-level `guidance` rules layer, and a persistent per-workflow workspace. Author definitions in conversation via the bundled `workflow` skill, then trigger from the CLI (`semaclaw workflow run`) or the Web UI's workflow dock — a live DAG view with run history and inline tuning. Runs only spawn isolated sessions and never touch your live chat agents.
- **Four-mode scheduled tasks** — Pure notification, pure script, pure agent, and hybrid script-plus-agent execution — matching mode to task complexity so token consumption stays proportional to reasoning work.
- **Agentic Wiki** — Transforms task outputs into structured, retrievable wiki entries indexed alongside agent memory, creating a compounding personal knowledge base that feeds back into future agent sessions.
- **Workbench: HTML-as-throwaway-UI** — A built-in rendering surface for agent-emitted deliverables. The `LaunchUI` tool lets agents ship interactive HTML, rich Markdown, embedded web services (iframe), or API-endpoint cards — the Web UI workbench mounts each artifact as a switchable history tab, no separate build step. Lean into "HTML as a disposable UI": ask an agent to *show you* a result instead of just describing it.
- **Multi-channel & Web UI** — Telegram, Feishu (Lark), and QQ adapters out of the box, plus a WebSocket gateway and a React-based Web UI.

## Featured plugin pack — Overture

[**Overture**](https://github.com/NingyanZhu/Overture) is a music-themed companion plugin pack that turns SemaClaw into a self-improving personal agent system. Install via **Plugin Marketplace → Add Source** by pasting the repo URL.

- **`notation`** — Data-flywheel hooks that capture every tool call, user correction, and outcome into structured logs. The signal feed for the two evolution loops below.
- **`cadence` & `repertoire`** — Two-layer self-evolution. `cadence` evolves the agent's *baseline genome* (prompts, policies, default heuristics) ; `repertoire` evolves the *skill library* — adding, refining, or retiring individual skills.
- **`timbre`** — Persona plugin packs. Each timbre bundles tone / values / expertise into a reusable character profile that any agent can wear, decoupling *who* the agent is from *what* it knows.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Install from npm (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install globally
npm install -g semaclaw

# 2. Run
semaclaw
```

That's it. Open the Web UI at **<http://127.0.0.1:18788/>**.

> **Install failed?** See [docs/INSTALL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/INSTALL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — covers the macOS `sharp` postinstall failure and other reported issues.

> **Configure an LLM on first launch.** SemaClaw starts without a built-in model. Open the Web UI → **Settings → LLM**, add a provider profile (OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepSeek / Qwen / …) with `baseURL`, `apiKey`, `modelName`. The profile is persisted to `~/.semaclaw/config.json` and synced to `~/.semaclaw/semaclaw-model.conf` — until at least one active profile exists, agent runs that call an LLM will fail.

To enable messaging channels (Telegram / Feishu / QQ / WeChat), create a `.env` file in your working directory before starting `semaclaw`. See [docs/QUICK_START.md](docs/QUICK_START.md) for the full list of environment variables.

### Option B — Build from source

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/midea-ai/SemaClaw.git
cd SemaClaw

# 2. Install and build
npm install
npm run build
npm run build:web

# 3. Configure (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to enable channels (Telegram / Feishu / QQ / WeChat).
# If left unset, SemaClaw starts in Web UI–only mode.

# 4. Run
npm start
```

Once started, open the Web UI at **<http://127.0.0.1:18788/>**, then go to **Settings → LLM** and add at least one active provider profile (see the note in Option A).

## About the Logo

The SemaClaw logo depicts a horse with **claw-shaped wings** rising from its back. The imagery is inspired by the Chinese phrase *以梦为马* — *"to ride one's dreams as a horse"* — capturing the spirit of an AI harness that carries the user wherever their imagination leads. The name itself blends *Sema* (from *semantic*) and *Claw*, while *harness* nods to the literal meaning of the word: the gear used to control and restrain a horse.

## Acknowledgments

SemaClaw is built on top of [sema-code-core](https://github.com/midea-ai/sema-code-core), which provides the underlying agent runtime. Its product form is also inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), and it integrates with the [ClaWHub](https://github.com/openclaw/clawhub) plugin marketplace from the same project. Thanks also to the broader open-source ecosystem this project depends on — including the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), [grammY](https://grammy.dev), and many others.

> SemaClaw's ambition is not to define the final architecture of personal AI agents — it is to advance the shared engineering foundation on which better architectures can be built.
