# aws-samples/sample-agentic-platform

A sample agentic ai platform to run agentic workflows on AWS using either EKS or Bedrock AgentCore with open source frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph, Strands, etc..

# Agentic Platform

A sample of what an agentic platform might look like on AWS. The repo demonstrates multiple compute layer options, a shared core library, gateway services, and a collection of agents built with different frameworks — all wired together as a working reference architecture.

It's organized as a **monorepo** so that coding agents (Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, etc.) can see the full picture in one place. A tree of `AGENTS.md` files helps these tools navigate the codebase — the root [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) acts as a table of contents pointing to domain-specific guides for [infrastructure](infrastructure/AGENTS.md), [Kubernetes](k8s/AGENTS.md), [application code](src/agentic_platform/AGENTS.md), [bootstrap](bootstrap/AGENTS.md), [tests](tests/AGENTS.md), and [labs](labs/AGENTS.md). The `CLAUDE.md` file simply says "see AGENTS.md" so the same scaffolding works across different tools.

## Project Status

This sample is actively maintained. Contributions welcome — see [Contributing](#contributing).

## Architecture at a Glance

The platform is organized into layered infrastructure stacks that you compose based on your needs:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Applications                           │
│  Agents · MCP Servers · Memory Gateway · Retrieval Gateway  │
├──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬───────────────┤
│   Option A   │                              │   Option B    │
│  Kubernetes  │      Knowledge Layer         │  AgentCore    │
│  (EKS +      │  (Bedrock Knowledge Base)    │  (ECS +       │
│   Helm)      │                              │   AgentCore   │
│              │                              │   Runtime)    │
├──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴───────────────┤
│                    Foundation Stack                          │
│          VPC · Subnets · NAT · Security Groups              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Infrastructure Stacks

| Stack | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Foundation** | `infrastructure/stacks/foundation/` | Networking (VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups). Deployed first — everything else builds on top. |
| **Platform EKS** | `infrastructure/stacks/platform-eks/` | EKS cluster, IRSA roles, Cognito, Aurora PostgreSQL, ElastiCache, bastion host, and the LiteLLM gateway deployed in-cluster. |
| **Platform AgentCore** | `infrastructure/stacks/platform-agentcore/` | "Lite" compute layer using ECS/Fargate. Deploys the LiteLLM gateway in ECS along with Cognito, Aurora, ElastiCache, and a bastion host. |
| **AgentCore Runtime** | `infrastructure/stacks/agentcore-runtime/` | Deploys individual agents into Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. Uses **Terraform workspaces** — one workspace per agent — to minimize duplicated infrastructure code. |
| **Knowledge Layer** | `infrastructure/stacks/knowledge-layer/` | Sets up a Bedrock Knowledge Base for RAG. Plans to evolve into a more sophisticated retrieval layer as more examples are added. |

### Choosing a Compute Layer

You deploy the **Foundation** stack first, then pick one of two paths:

**Option A — Kubernetes (EKS):** Full control. Deploy the `platform-eks` stack, then deploy agents and services via Helm charts under `k8s/`. The LLM gateway, telemetry collectors, and other platform shims run in the cluster alongside your agents.

**Option B — AgentCore (ECS + Managed Runtime):** Less operational overhead. Deploy the `platform-agentcore` stack to get the LLM gateway running in ECS, then deploy agents into AgentCore Runtime using the `agentcore-runtime` stack (one Terraform workspace per agent).

Both paths share the same agent code. Every agent implements the **AgentCore interface** (port `8080`, `/invocations` endpoint), so it's up to you where you deploy.

### Lifecycle Separation

The platform distinguishes between two lifecycles:

- **Platform infrastructure** (LLM gateway, telemetry, auth shims) — changes infrequently, managed by the platform team.
- **Application code** (agents, MCP servers, supporting services) — changes frequently, deployed independently by application teams.

This separation is reflected in the stack design and the Helm chart layout.

## Architecture Diagrams

### EKS-Based Architecture
![High Level Architecture](media/highlevel-architecture.png)

### Agent Process Architecture
![Agent Process Architecture](media/agent-design.png)

Each agent runs as a FastAPI server sharing a core package with types, client abstractions, and middleware. Agents don't hold IAM roles directly — they connect to AWS resources through gateway services (LLM Gateway, Memory Gateway, Retrieval Gateway) that use IRSA. All inter-service communication is authenticated via JWT tokens validated against the IDP's public cert. Telemetry is collected via OpenTelemetry and pushed to X-Ray, CloudWatch, and OpenSearch.

### AgentCore Architecture
![AgentCore Architecture](media/agentcore-arch.png)

A managed approach using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore primitives with ECS for the gateway layer and AgentCore Runtime for agent execution.

## Repository Layout

| Directory | What's in it |
|-----------|-------------|
| `infrastructure/` | Terraform stacks and 20+ reusable modules |
| `k8s/` | Helm charts and per-application values for EKS deployments |
| `src/agentic_platform/` | Agent implementations, shared core library, gateway services, MCP servers, and tools |
| `labs/` | 5 learning modules with 25+ Jupyter notebooks |
| `bootstrap/` | CloudFormation templates for bootstrapping AWS accounts |
| `deploy/` | Build and deploy scripts |
| `tests/` | Unit and integration tests |

## Agents

Sample agents built with different frameworks — all sharing the same interface (port `8080`, `/invocations`, `/health`):

| Agent | Framework | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `agentic_chat` | Strands | General-purpose chat agent |
| `agentic_rag` | Strands | RAG agent backed by Bedrock Knowledge Base |
| `langgraph_chat` | LangGraph | Chat agent using LangGraph workflows |
| `jira_agent` | Strands | Jira integration agent |
| `strands_glue_athena` | Strands | AWS Glue & Athena data agent |

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full development guide.

## Labs

Five progressive modules that take you from fundamentals to production:

| Module | Topic | What You'll Learn |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **1** | Prompt Engineering & Evaluation | Bedrock Converse API, chain-of-thought, few-shot, RAG basics, function calling, evaluation |
| **2** | Common Agentic Patterns | Prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestration, evaluator-optimizer |
| **3** | Building Agentic Applications | Agent memory, tools, retrieval, framework interoperability |
| **4** | Multi-Agent Systems & MCP | MCP servers & clients, multi-agent delegation, agent graphs, AgentCore tools |
| **5** | Deployment & Infrastructure | OpenTelemetry, LLM gateway, memory gateway, streaming, scaling |

Only Module 5 requires the platform to be deployed. To run labs locally:

```bash
uv sync
uv run jupyter lab
```
