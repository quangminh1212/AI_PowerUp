AXIS is an open source tooling and a scoring framework to measure how well services work for AI agents. Think [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse), but for agent experience.

Give AXIS a scenario, an agent, and a prompt. It runs the agent, captures a full transcript, and produces a graded score across four independent dimensions: Goal Achievement, Environment, Service, and Agent.

## Why AXIS

The web has Lighthouse. APIs have contract testing. Performance has k6. But there's no standardized way to answer: "How well does my system work when an AI agent tries to use it?".

As agents become a primary interface for interacting with sites, APIs, and developer platforms, the systems they interact with need to be measured and optimized for that experience — just like we optimize for page load time or accessibility. AXIS is that measurement.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install @netlify/axis
```

`axis.config.json`:

```json
{
  "scenarios": "./scenarios",
  "agents": ["claude-code"]
}
```

`scenarios/hello-world.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Hello world",
  "prompt": "Navigate to https://example.com and describe what you see on the page.",
  "judge": [
    { "check": "Agent visited the target URL", "weight": 0.5 },
    { "check": "Agent provided a description of the page content", "weight": 0.5 }
  ]
}
```

```bash
axis run
```

AXIS executes the scenario, scores the result, and writes a report to `.axis/reports/`.

## Documentation

Full documentation lives at **[axis.run](https://axis.run)**:

- [Quick start](https://axis.run/quickstart) - install through your first scored run
- [Configuration](https://axis.run/configuration) - `axis.config.json`, scenarios, MCP servers, skills
- [CLI reference](https://axis.run/cli) - `axis run`, `axis reports`, `axis baseline`
- [Running tests](https://axis.run/running) - execution model, workspace isolation, custom adapters, CI integration
- [Scoring framework](https://axis.run/scoring) - the four dimensions, signals, calibration

## Programmatic API

Use the programmatic API when you want to integrate AXIS into an existing test runner, build tool, or CI pipeline rather than calling the CLI directly.

## Roadmap

Delivered: scenario runner, four-dimension scoring pipeline, baselines with regression detection, MCP/skills wiring, custom adapter API, built-in adapters for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini.

Planned:

- **Historical trending** - score regression detection over time
- **AXIS badge** - embeddable score badge for READMEs
- **Configurable judge** - separate adapter/model for scoring, independent of the agent under test
- **Score thresholds** - CI gating with configurable pass/fail thresholds
- **Human interruption detection** - penalize agent requests for human intervention

## Contributing

AXIS is built in the open. Contributions are welcome. New scenarios, agent adapters,
bug fixes, and documentation improvements all help.
