## 🔌 Protocols & Standards

CrewForm is a self-hostable runtime with native support for the three protocols that matter for interoperable agent systems:

| Protocol | Direction | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) | 🔌 Client + 🔧 Server | **Client:** Agents discover and call tools from any MCP server. **Server:** Expose your agents as MCP tools for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients. |
| **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) | ↔️ Bidirectional | **Consume:** Delegate tasks to external A2A agents. **Publish:** Expose your agents for other AI systems to call. Cross-framework agent interop. |
| **AG-UI** (Agent-User Interface) | 📡 Streaming | Real-time SSE event streaming from agent to frontend. Supports text deltas, tool calls, state transitions, and rich interactions (approval, confirmation, choices). |

> **Why this matters:** Most platforms create isolated agent workflows. CrewForm gives your agents access to external tools (MCP), cross-framework agent interop (A2A), and real-time frontend streaming (AG-UI) — all from one runtime layer.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Hosted (Fastest)

Sign up at [crewform.tech](https://crewform.tech) — free tier includes 3 agents and 50 tasks/month.

### Self-Hosted (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrewForm/crewform.git
cd crewform
cp .env.example .env  # Edit with your config
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** — done!

#### 🔬 Research Crew Edition

Want to start with a pre-configured pipeline? The Research Crew variant includes 3 agents (Researcher → Analyst → Writer) ready to go:

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # Edit with your API keys
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.research-crew.yml up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000, create a task with any topic, and watch the Research Crew produce a polished article.

⚡ **Local Models:** Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) alongside CrewForm for fully local AI — zero API keys, zero data leaving your network. Run `ollama pull llama3.3` and select Ollama as a provider in Settings.

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrewForm/crewform.git
cd crewform
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

> 📖 See the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://docs.crewform.tech/self-hosting) for production deployment details.

### One-Click Deploy

Deploy the CrewForm task runner with a single click:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/pH5MkZ?referralCode=g38HaT&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)
[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/CrewForm/crewform)

You'll need to provide your own Supabase credentials and LLM API keys after deployment.

### CLI (No Server Required)

Run agents directly from your terminal — no browser, no Supabase, no Docker:

```bash
# Create an agent config
npx crewform init

# Run it (defaults to Ollama; or set OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.)
npx crewform run agent.json "Summarise the latest AI news"

# Interactive chat
npx crewform chat agent.json

# Run a multi-agent pipeline team
npx crewform init --team
npx crewform run team.json "Research and write about GraphQL"

# Connect to MCP servers
npx crewform run agent.json --mcp servers.json "Query my database"

# Connect to your CrewForm workspace
npx crewform login
npx crewform agents
npx crewform pull <agent-id>
```

## Why CrewForm?

CrewForm is built as agent infrastructure, not just another workflow canvas. It gives you the runtime layer around multi-agent systems: protocols, execution, observability, deployment, memory, APIs, and visual operations.

- 🔌 **Protocol-native runtime** — Use MCP as a client and server, delegate across A2A, and stream agent state to frontends with AG-UI
- 🖥️ **Visual control plane** — Design, run, debug, and monitor agents, teams, handoffs, tool calls, and execution state from a visual UI
- 🏠 **Infrastructure ownership** — Self-host with Docker, bring your own LLM keys, use local models with Ollama, and avoid hosted model markup
- 📡 **Runtime observability** — Trace LLM calls, tool usage, team runs, costs, failures, and handoffs with OpenTelemetry and Langfuse
- 🔀 **Flexible orchestration** — Run single-agent tasks, fixed pipelines, brain-and-worker orchestrators, or multi-agent collaboration threads
- 📚 **Knowledge and memory** — Add RAG, pgvector search, team memory, output templates, and file artifacts to agent workflows
- ⚡ **Integration surface** — Expose agents through REST APIs, webhooks, chat widgets, Zapier, messaging channels, MCP, and A2A
- 🔒 **Secure workspace model** — Encrypted API keys, Row-Level Security, workspaces, RBAC, audit logs, and usage controls
- 📦 **Portable workflows** — Export/import agents and teams, install templates, and package repeatable systems for clients or internal teams

The result is a shared control plane for teams moving from isolated agent experiments to reliable agent systems they can operate.

## How It Works

CrewForm supports 4 execution modes — choose the right one for your workflow:

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/workflow-modes.png" alt="CrewForm Workflow Modes" width="700" />
</p>

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Single Task** | Send a prompt to one agent — it uses its LLM and tools, then returns the result. The simplest way to get work done. |
| **Pipeline** | Chain multiple agents in sequence. Each agent completes its task and passes the output to the next. Great for research → write → review workflows. |
| **Orchestrator** | A brain agent breaks down the task, delegates sub-tasks to worker agents, reviews their outputs, and assembles the final result. |
| **Collaboration** | Multiple agents discuss the task in a shared thread, debate approaches, and converge on a consensus result. |

## Who It's For

### Platform Engineering Teams

Give your organization a shared runtime for internal agents, model access, tool connections, memory, workflows, observability, and deployment.

**Best for:** internal AI platforms, self-hosted agent infrastructure, compliance-conscious environments, and shared model/tool governance.

### AI Product Teams

Add agent workflows to real products without rebuilding orchestration, streaming, tool use, memory, and runtime APIs from scratch.

**Best for:** embedded copilots, agent-powered SaaS features, customer-facing automations, chat widgets, and AG-UI progress streams.

### Consultancies and Agencies

Deploy repeatable, client-owned AI systems with isolated workspaces, reusable templates, BYOK cost control, transparent traces, and production handoff paths.

**Best for:** client automation projects, AI transformation teams, multi-tenant delivery, and packaged workflow templates.

### AI Builders and Developers

Move from scripts and prototypes to managed agent systems with visual operations, deployment, APIs, tracing, and protocol integrations.

**Best for:** LangGraph/CrewAI-style prototypes becoming products, MCP/A2A demos, local model workflows, and multi-agent experiments.

---

> **The core shift CrewForm supports:** move from isolated agent experiments to a shared runtime your team can deploy, observe, and operate.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What is CrewForm?</strong></summary>

CrewForm is an open-source AI orchestration platform that lets you deploy, manage, and collaborate on multi-agent AI workflows through a visual UI — without vendor lock-in or LLM cost markup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is CrewForm free to use?</strong></summary>

Yes. CrewForm's Community Edition is open-source under the AGPL v3 license. You can self-host it for free. We also offer a hosted version with a free tier at [crewform.tech](https://crewform.tech). Paid plans (Pro $39/mo, Team $99/mo, Enterprise custom) unlock additional features.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the CE/EE split?</strong></summary>

CrewForm uses an open-core model. All code outside `ee/` is Community Edition (AGPL-3.0, free). Code inside `ee/` is Enterprise Edition (proprietary, requires a license key). CE includes agents, pipeline teams, marketplace, and self-hosting. EE adds orchestrator mode, collaboration, memory, audit logs, and more.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What does BYOK mean?</strong></summary>

BYOK stands for **Bring Your Own Key**. You connect your own API keys from providers like Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI. CrewForm never touches your LLM spend — you pay your provider directly at their standard rates.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I self-host CrewForm?</strong></summary>

Yes! CrewForm supports Docker-based self-hosting. See our [self-hosting guide](https://docs.crewform.tech/self-hosting) for instructions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What LLM providers are supported?</strong></summary>

CrewForm supports **16 cloud providers + Ollama** for local models:

OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, Mistral, Cohere, NVIDIA NIM, Perplexity, Together, OpenRouter, HuggingFace, MiniMax, Moonshot, Venice, xAI, and **Ollama** (local — Llama 3, Mistral, Phi, etc.).

Ollama enables fully air-gapped setups — zero API keys, zero data leaving your network. More providers can be added via the modular provider architecture.

<details>
<summary><strong>What integrations are available?</strong></summary>

CrewForm integrates with **Zapier** (7,000+ apps), messaging channels (**Discord**, **Slack**, **Telegram**, **Email**, **Trello**), output routes (**webhooks**, **MS Teams**, **Asana**, **Trello**, and more), and three agentic protocols: **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) for connecting to thousands of external tool servers, **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent) for delegating tasks to external AI agents, and **AG-UI** (Agent-User Interface) for real-time SSE streaming to any frontend.

<details>
<summary><strong>How does CrewForm differ from CrewAI or LangGraph?</strong></summary>

CrewAI and LangGraph are code-first orchestration libraries. CrewForm is a self-hostable control plane around agent systems: visual orchestration, task execution, workspaces, billing, RBAC, marketplace/templates, messaging channels, RAG, observability, REST APIs, and production deployment. It also treats interoperability as a core runtime concern with native MCP, A2A, and AG-UI support.

## How CrewForm Compares

| Capability | CrewForm | Others |
|---|---|---|
| **Visual Control Plane** | ✅ Drag-and-drop canvas + live execution | Often code-only or basic flow editors |
| **Multi-Agent Teams** | ✅ 3 modes — Pipeline, Orchestrator, Collaboration | Usually single-mode or code-defined |
| **MCP Protocol** | ✅ Client + Server (bidirectional) | Typically client-only or unsupported |
| **A2A Protocol** | ✅ Bidirectional (consume + publish) | Not supported |
| **AG-UI Protocol** | ✅ SSE + rich interactions | Not supported |
| **Protocol-Native Runtime** | ✅ MCP + A2A + AG-UI — native | Usually zero or one |
| **LLM Providers** | ✅ 16 + Ollama (local) | Often limited or requires plugins |
| **BYOK (zero markup)** | ✅ Your keys, your cost | Often limited providers or markup fees |
| **Local Models (Ollama)** | ✅ Native, fully air-gapped | Varies |
| **RAG / Knowledge Base** | ✅ Hybrid search + retrieval tester | Sometimes available, often requires plugins |
| **Chat Widget** | ✅ One script tag, streaming, domain security | Rare — usually requires custom dev |
| **Observability** | ✅ OTLP + Langfuse | Sometimes available |
| **Fan-Out (Parallel)** | ✅ Built-in branching + merge | Rare in visual tools |
| **Agent Marketplace** | ✅ Browse, install, publish | Rare in open-source tools |
| **Workflow Templates** | ✅ Variable-driven blueprints with one-click install | Not available |
| **Data Portability** | ✅ JSON export/import for agents and teams | Usually locked to platform |
| **Self-Hosting** | ✅ One-command Docker Compose | Often cloud-only or complex setup |
| **Open Source** | ✅ AGPL-3.0 | Varies |

> CrewForm combines native MCP, A2A, and AG-UI with a visual runtime, self-hosting, BYOK, knowledge, APIs, and observability so teams can operate interoperable agent systems instead of stitching isolated tools together.
