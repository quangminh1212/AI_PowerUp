# CoCo Super Intelligence

### Summon an advisory board of 389 world-class minds — right inside your AI coding session.

CoCo Super Intelligence is the orchestration layer that turns Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex into an entire engineering department: routed expert panels that deliberate and decide, then **147 skills**, **277 commands**, and disk-persistent state that ship what they decided.

Open-core (MIT core · proprietary Super Intelligence) · installs in 90 seconds · 100% local · no telemetry

## What CoCo Is (and Isn't)

**CoCo is not a new AI model, and it is not another agent harness.** It doesn't run a model or an agent loop of its own. It's a portable layer of Markdown and YAML that installs *into* the agent harness you already use — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, or any `AGENTS.md`-compatible tool — and upgrades it with an expert advisory board, a skills library, persistent project memory, specialized subagents, and verification gates.

Your model, your tool, your keys, your machine. When you see "parallel subagent waves," those subagents are executed by your host harness's own agent machinery; CoCo supplies the orchestration structure that makes it all behave like a coordinated team. That is exactly why CoCo is vendor-neutral: it's the operating layer, not the engine.

---

<a id="the-board"></a>

## ⭐ The Board — CoCo Super Intelligence

### A cross-team advisory board of 389 world-class minds

Super Intelligence is CoCo's signature capability. It lets you summon custom, real-world expert panels directly inside your coding session to guide architectural, engineering, risk, finance, and business decisions — each contribution attributed to a named expert, grounded in cited public sources.

```bash
/SI-Decide "Should we migrate our database to pgvector?"
/SI-AI-Decide "Which embedding model gives the best cost/performance?"
/SI-Eng-Pre-Mortem "Review our zero-downtime cache migration strategy"
/SI-GRC-Review "Check this customer onboarding flow for GDPR compliance"
```

**389 expert personas**, organized across 9 specialized departments:

| Department | Experts | Focus |
|---|---:|---|
| **Engineering** | 70 | Software architecture, cloud systems, systems coding, compilers, infrastructure |
| **AI** | 59 | Neural-network research, LLM optimization, safety, alignment, vector databases |
| **Product & Design** | 56 | Design systems, UX, product strategy, growth loops |
| **Finance** | 47 | Valuation, corporate finance, macro modeling, fintech infrastructure |
| **Trading** | 46 | Quant analysis, market microstructure, derivatives pricing, crypto liquidity |
| **Risk & Compliance (GRC)** | 30 | GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, security auditing, international regulation |
| **Strategy** | 29 | Platform economics, business models, competitive analysis |
| **Data & Analytics** | 29 | Data engineering, pipeline optimization, predictive modeling |
| **Sales / GTM / Marketing** | 23 | Product-market fit, sales ops, growth marketing, enterprise GTM |

- **242 generated slash commands.** 17 cross-team meta commands (like `/SI-Decide` or `/SI-Tradeoff`, routing across domains) plus 225 per-team commands (25 verbs × 9 teams, such as `/SI-AI-Decide` or `/SI-Eng-Pre-Mortem`). These are generated locally at install time from the team registries — no command files are transmitted or stored remotely.
- **70 expertise cells.** Each department is subdivided into focused cells (e.g. Engineering has 11, AI has 8) so the router can assemble a precise panel rather than a generic crowd.
- **Cross-team meta-orchestration.** For complex queries spanning domains ("build and sell an AI audit tool"), a local router scores your prompt against team registries and cells, then greedily assembles a proportional 16–32-person panel.
- **Citable and grounded.** Every stance is verified from public sources and carries a direct evidence URL. Personas are validated against a strict anti-fabrication gate.
- **`--debate` deliberation.** Panels can argue in reacting rounds before returning a verdict, surfacing named dissent instead of false consensus.

### The selection algorithm (two-stage routing + approval)

The meta-orchestrator uses a staged algorithm so it never has to load the entire persona filesystem at runtime:

1. **Stage A — team & cell routing (cheap).** Reads the meta-registry (`systems/superintelligence/registry.json`) and scans only team descriptions and cell definitions, scoring relevance by keyword and domain overlap to select the top 1–4 teams. If one team dominates, it delegates to that team's own orchestrator.
2. **Stage B — scoped persona selection.** Loads compact persona records (slugs, cells, domains, stances, conflict mappings) for only the selected teams, allocates the 16–32-person budget proportionally, runs the greedy scorer (`0.40·domain + 0.30·cell-coverage + 0.30·conflict-pairing`), and applies a cross-team tension pass to pair opposing viewpoints (e.g. security vs. growth).
3. **Stage C — approval & execution.** Presents the roster grouped by team with a one-line rationale. The action verb then consumes the approved roster and returns output with full line-by-line attribution (e.g. "Aswath Damodaran (Finance): …").

### Persona build & validation pipeline

The 389-persona roster was compiled with a systematic multi-tier workflow. Candidate generation was evaluated across local Qwen (via LM Studio), a hosted small model, and Gemini Flash, but **Claude research agents proved the quality winner** for resolving historical data and citing verifiable signal. Every persona then passes a validation gate (`validate_persona.py`) requiring at least 4 live, non-404 evidence URLs, a valid home team, zero fabricated quotes, and at least 2 verified recent signals (or persistent archetype signals for historical figures).

## The Framework Underneath

The board decides. The framework ships. Three pillars turn the verdict into merged, verified code.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 1. Autonomous team execution
`/team:ship` runs a fully coordinated build pipeline — 6 development stages and 7 hard verification gates. Specialized agents act in their domains (Research, Architecture, Plan, Review, Build, QA). Code must clear the Test Evidence Protocol (independent re-runs, strict coverage, skip-prevention) before a pull request is opened.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 2. Disk-persistent state
AI chat context is fragile and wipes on `/clear`. CoCo persists phase state, decisions, and progress logs to disk across resets, with atomic git commits for every successful step — so you can review history, roll back a bad design path, or resume a long-running migration from any checkpoint.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 3. Vendor-neutral portability
CoCo compiles its rules, templates, and agent definitions into pure Markdown and YAML frontmatter. Native IDE adapters inject the same library into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, or any `AGENTS.md` tool — so your workflows follow you even if you switch AI editors.

## System Bundles

Bundles are opt-in packages that extend the workspace with specialized databases, pipelines, and rosters. Enable them with `--systems <name>`.

### 1. GSD (Get Shit Done)
An orchestration engine of **68 skills and 24 agents** that manages the lifecycle of complex codebases. A disk-backed phase database records goals, decisions, milestones, and blockers; **workstreams** spin up isolated git checkouts to test refactors without polluting main; **forensics** performs post-mortem root-cause audits when a phase fails; and **autonomous mode** runs parallel waves of subagents through plan milestones end-to-end.

### 2. Brain
A local knowledge-graph engine of **6 skills** connecting email, chat, code, and docs. A local SQLite store indexes code entities, business decisions, project terms, and stakeholder feedback; a **wiki generator** builds hyperlinked articles for every recorded entity; and mail sync links project email threads to related files.

### 3. Team
A multi-agent product-team pipeline (`/team:ship`, `/team:plan`, `/team:review`, `/team:verify`, and more). It spawns specialized subagents — Research, Architect, QA — to execute changes, review diffs, and write tests, with deterministic gates that intercept merges to run lints, import audits, reference checks, and verification suites.

### 4. Super Intelligence
The **389-persona advisory board** and its **242 generated `/SI-*` commands** across 9 departments — the hero capability described [above](#the-board).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is CoCo an AI model or an agent harness?</strong></summary>
Neither. CoCo is a portable layer of Markdown and YAML that installs into the agent harness you already use (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, or any AGENTS.md tool). Your host harness runs the model and executes the agents; CoCo supplies the skills, commands, agents, rules, and persona board that make it act like a coordinated team.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my codebase or data sent to a third party?</strong></summary>
No. CoCo is entirely local — Markdown, configuration, and shell scripts on your machine. Your existing AI tool's privacy policy is unchanged, and CoCo adds no telemetry.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I modify or customize a skill?</strong></summary>
Every skill lives at <code>skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md</code>. Edit it directly to refine instructions or add tools, then run <code>bash install.sh</code> to refresh the symlinks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I cleanly uninstall CoCo?</strong></summary>
Because CoCo uses symbolic links, removal is non-destructive:
<pre>find ~/.claude ~/.cursor -type l -lname "*$(pwd)*" -delete</pre>
This removes only the links pointing back to your CoCo repository folder.

## Built On

CoCo Super Intelligence stands on the shoulders of excellent open-source work. Special thanks to:

- **[obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** (Jesse Vincent) — the foundational engineering-discipline skills (brainstorming, systematic debugging, TDD, plan writing/execution, git worktrees, code-review flows, verification, and skill authoring).
- **[gsd-build/get-shit-done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)** — the 68-skill / 24-agent GSD project-orchestration bundle.
- **[JCodesMore/ai-website-cloner-template](https://github.com/JCodesMore/ai-website-cloner-template)** — the site-cloning structure behind `clone-website`.
- **[agents.md](https://agents.md/)** community — the vendor-neutral agent-context standard CoCo's adapters follow.
- **[nickwinder/synthteam](https://github.com/nickwinder/synthteam)** (Nick Winder) — the multi-agent debate protocol behind `--debate` deliberation.
- **[latent-spaces/brag](https://github.com/latent-spaces/brag)** (Shunit Haviv) and **[HyperFrames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperframes)** (HeyGen) — the launch-video flow and local render engine behind `coco-ads`.
- **[leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/leonxlnx/taste-skill)** (Leon) — the design-taste enforcement behind `design-taste-frontend` and `redesign-existing-projects`.
- **[HKUDS/CLI-Anything](https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything)** — the "wrap any CLI into a structured skill" methodology behind `cli-anything`.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** and **[vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines](https://github.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines)** — the source material behind `vercel-react-best-practices` and `web-design-guidelines`.
