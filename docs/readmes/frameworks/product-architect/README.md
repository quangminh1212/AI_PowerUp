# Product Architect

**The most comprehensive open-source product development skill for Claude.**

48 agents · 33 frameworks · Research-first, depth to the Mariana Trench · Solo founder Day 0 → IPO → public company

> **This is a [Claude Skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/skills).** Claude reads `SKILL.md`. This README is for human visitors.

## Install

### Claude.ai (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)

> **Skills require a paid plan.** Free tier does not have access to Skills, including "Add from GitHub."

1. Download this repo as ZIP (Code → Download ZIP)
2. Go to Claude.ai → Settings → Capabilities → Skills
3. Upload the ZIP
4. Test: Ask Claude *"Help me build a product"* or *"Write a PRD for [feature]"*

### Claude Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankitjha67/product-architect.git
# Place in your Claude Code skills directory (~/.claude/skills/)
```

### API
Use the `/v1/skills` endpoint with the `container.skills` parameter. Requires Code Execution Tool beta.

### Free Tier Workarounds

If you're on the free plan, you can still use everything in this repo:

1. **Guided mode (recommended)** — Open [`START-HERE.md`](START-HERE.md) on GitHub, click **Raw**, copy everything, paste into a new Claude chat. Describe your idea — Claude will ask what you're building, identify the right agents, give you exact GitHub URLs to paste them one at a time, and guide you through the entire product development process step by step.

2. **Projects** — Create a Project in Claude.ai, paste `SKILL.md` + `SMART-LOADER.md` as project knowledge. Then paste individual agent/framework files as needed per conversation.

3. **Direct paste** — Open any file on GitHub (e.g. `frameworks/founders-playbook.md`), copy the raw content, and paste it into a regular Claude chat. Every file works standalone.

4. **Claude Code** — If you have Claude Code access, clone the repo into your skills directory. Skills load automatically.

## Key Architecture

**Research-First Depth** — Before recommending building anything, agents run the **Deep Research Protocol** (Agent 47): an end-to-end market investigation that returns a grounded verdict — *"this already exists, here are the competitors + citations, refine it"* or *"this is white-space, no competition/citations in this niche"* (with the honest caveat that absence of evidence isn't proof of novelty, plus a "why is it empty?" analysis). Every agent inherits a Depth Rubric (L0 surface → L4 Mariana Trench), must grade itself L3+, and never fabricates a company, statistic, study, patent, or URL.

**Smart Loading** — `SMART-LOADER.md` routes each request to only the relevant agents. Scores agents 0-10 on relevance, handles multi-intent requests, supports dynamic mid-conversation loading. Never loads everything at once. Free tier: 3 agents/turn. Pro: 5 agents/turn.

**Cross-Agent Governance** — 5-level authority hierarchy prevents contradictions: Compliance (override) → Privacy/DPO (override) → Security (override) → Finance (veto) → Chief Reviewer (veto). 5-step conflict protocol: stop, state, apply hierarchy, document, flag.

**KDR Memory** — Key Decision Records with sequential numbering, conflict detection (scan-before-record), and SUPERSEDED mechanism. Survives chat compaction. Works on free tier. Paste MASTER KDR into new conversations to resume.

**Agent Standards** — Shared quality protocol inherited by all agents: before/during/after checklists, iterative refinement loops, performance rules, cross-reference table mapping every agent to related frameworks.
