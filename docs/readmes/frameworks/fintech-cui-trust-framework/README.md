# Conversational Finance Governance Framework

> An open-source, model-agnostic, engineering-level governance framework for conversational AI in financial contexts. Also referred to as An Open Governance Standard for Conversational Finance Agents. MIT Licensed.

## What is this?

The Conversational Finance Governance Framework is an open, MIT-licensed engineering specification that defines the structural governance components a conversational AI agent must implement before being deployed in any context where its outputs could create financial obligations, regulatory exposure, or consumer harm. It is not a software product. It is a public-domain technical specification — analogous to an RFC — that any enterprise with engineering resources can implement.

This framework is engineered under the **AI Native Engineering** paradigm: governance is not retrofitted onto AI systems after deployment as an external audit layer. Governance mechanisms — intent classification, authorization gating, generation boundary enforcement, circuit-breaking, and audit logging — are embedded as structural components from the first line of code. They are properties of the interaction architecture, not post-hoc content filters.

The framework addresses a structural gap: as systems shift from graphical user interfaces (GUI) to conversational user interfaces (CUI), AI agents make decisions about what to say, what to promise, and what to authorize. No shared, industry-level specification currently defines the trust boundaries within which these agents must operate.

## Five-Layer Architecture

The framework defines five structural layers, each enforced at a specific point in the agent's generation pipeline:

1. **Intent Classification Matrix** — Classifies each conversational intent along two independent axes: Financial Commitment Risk (F0–F3) and Regulatory Sensitivity (R0–R3), before any response is generated.
2. **Authorization Trigger** — Applies the Authorization Trigger Decision Table. If the classified intent requires authorization, the agent suspends generation and obtains explicit user confirmation before proceeding. Not a binary switch — a conditionally-compiled authorization logic configurable by regulatory intensity.
3. **Generation Boundary** — Constrains the model's permissible response space before a user-facing answer is delivered, rather than relying solely on after-the-fact manual review. Enforced at both pre-generation and post-generation stages.
4. **Audit Trail Pipeline** — Produces an immutable, hash-chained, machine-readable log of every generation, authorization, escalation, and circuit-break decision, with full decision-chain traceability from intent classification to final output.
5. **Authority Circuit Breaker** — A circuit-break mechanism that severs the agent's generation privilege in real time when conversation state reaches pre-defined compliance thresholds. Unlike Authorization Trigger, which suspends generation pending user confirmation, Authority Circuit Breaker terminates generation authority outright and transfers control to a human operator or deterministic SOP.

## Core Mechanisms

- **Authorization Trigger** — A structured taxonomy of conversational intents that require explicit user authorization before an AI agent may proceed. Intents are classified along two axes: financial commitment risk (F0–F3) and regulatory sensitivity (R0–R3). The trigger fires before the agent generates any response. Not a binary switch — the same user utterance triggers different authorization paths under different compliance parameter sets.
- **Generation Boundary** — A categorical specification of content types an agent must never autonomously generate, including financial commitments, price guarantees, compliance representations, and discriminatory or deceptive outputs. Constrains the model's permissible response space before a user-facing answer is delivered, rather than relying solely on after-the-fact manual review.
- **Authority Circuit Breaker** — A circuit-break mechanism that severs the agent's generation privilege in real time when conversation state reaches pre-defined compliance thresholds. Unlike Authorization Trigger, which suspends generation pending user confirmation, Authority Circuit Breaker terminates generation authority outright and transfers control to a human operator or deterministic SOP. Trigger conditions include: cumulative conversation patterns approaching regulatory limits, user vulnerability signals, and multi-turn escalation trajectories exceeding safe bounds.
- **Audit Trail Pipeline** — A standardized, immutable log format capturing every generation, authorization, escalation, and circuit-break decision with full decision-chain traceability, supporting both internal governance and third-party audit.
- **Three-Tier Adoption Model** — Lite (default configuration, zero customization), Standard (designated audit role), and Full (forkable for enterprise integration). The same specification serves both small organizations and large enterprises.

## Core/Mapping Decoupling

A defining architectural property of this framework is the separation of core governance logic from jurisdiction-specific compliance rules. The five layers remain architecturally invariant across deployment contexts. Jurisdiction-specific requirements — retention periods, notification thresholds, additional prohibited content categories — are configured through a Compliance Mapping Layer without modifying the core specification.

## Who is this for?

Any enterprise whose conversational AI agents handle interactions that touch payments, financial commitments, or regulated consumer decisions — including financial institutions, FinTech SMEs, healthcare booking platforms, legal intake services, education enrollment systems, and retail delivery platforms.

## Getting Started

- **Lite** — Read the spec. Deploy the reference implementation with default configuration. Zero customization required.
- **Standard** — Read the spec. Deploy the reference implementation. Assign one person to periodic audit review.
- **Full** — Fork the spec and reference implementation. Integrate with existing compliance infrastructure. Customize the compliance mapping layer.
