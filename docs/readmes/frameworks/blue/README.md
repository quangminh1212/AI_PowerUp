# megagonlabs/blue

Blue is an open-source framework for building enterprise-ready agentic workflows through compound AI system architecture. Blue uses streams for orchestration, structured communication for control, and seamless integration with existing infrastructure.

---

# What is Blue?

Blue is an agent orchestration platform for building and deploying applications with agentic workflows for the enterprise. 

A key target use-case of Blue is enterprise, i.e. integrate an existing enterprise infrastructure with advanced AI, LLMs, and beyond for a wide-variety of enterprise use-cases. We aim to leverage what already exist in the enterprise infrastructure, i.e. existing APIs, models, and data in their original source, format, and systems and couple them with new capabilities.

Blue is currently a research project to explore the design space of agent orchestration systems, agentic planning and data processing, to support a variety of use-cases: from non-interactive use cases to conversational interaction, from fixed workflows to ad-hoc workflows with planners, from applications working on purely relational data to multi-modal data  (incl. semi-structured text, graphs, and beyond), from purely textual interaction to interactive agents with user interfaces, charts, and beyond. 

# What are key concepts in Blue?

To help facilitate ‘Agentic for Enterprise’ we are introducing several concepts in the design of our framework, including:
- **Streams** to facilitate data, control, and communication among agents
- **Messages** in streams to standardize of data and instructions for agents
- **Registries** to capture metadata about data, agents and beyond
- **Session** to provide context (and shared memory) for computation
- **Plans** to represent workflows and execution of agents
- **Planners** to craft task and data plans
- **Tools** to interface with external sources and APIs
- **Operators** to perform data-intenstive functions

# How does Blue work?

To get a glimpse of where we are heading with agentic architectures, read our papers:

# What can you build with Blue?

Here are a few examples to inspire you to build with blue:

* a set of agents that convert natural language to SQL, executes, and summarizes results in natural language 
* agents that produces interactive graphical user interfaces and visualizations with your data (e.g. self-service business intelligence) 
* a conversational agent that interfaces to existing predictive models and APIs (e.g. job search agent with predictive models and data)
* agents that execute workflows processing text data, extracting and populating databases.
* conversational applications with agents managing dialogue and performing task planning.
* complex agentic data processing pipelines, with multi-modal operators

# Where are blue libraries?

Blue has two python libraries that you can use:
* [blue-platform](https://pypi.org/project/blue-platform/): developers library for building agents, tools, operators, planners
* [blue-cli](https://pypi.org/project/blue-cli/): cli to install and deploy blue

[blue-cli](https://pypi.org/project/blue-cli/) is a good starting point to install and try out blue!
