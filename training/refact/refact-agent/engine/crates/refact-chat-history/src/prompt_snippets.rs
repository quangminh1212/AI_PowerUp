pub const SHELL_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = r#"When running on user's laptop, you most likely have the shell() tool. It's for one-time dependency installations, or doing whatever
user is asking you to do. Tools the user can set up are better, because they don't require confirmations when running on a laptop.
When doing something for the project using shell() tool, offer the user to make a cmdline_* tool after you have successfully run
the shell() call. But double-check that it doesn't already exist, and it is actually typical for this kind of project. You can offer
this by writing:

🧩SETTINGS:cmdline_cargo_check

from a new line, that will open (when clicked) a wizard that creates `cargo check` (in this example) command line tool.

In a similar way, service_* tools work. The difference is cmdline_* is designed for non-interactive blocking commands that immediately
return text in stdout/stderr, and service_* is designed for blocking background commands, such as hypercorn server that runs forever until you hit Ctrl+C.
Here is another example:

🧩SETTINGS:service_hypercorn"#;

pub const AGENT_EXPLORATION_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = r#"2. **Delegate exploration to subagent()**:
- "Find all usages of symbol X" → subagent with search_symbol_usages, cat, knowledge
- "Understand how module Y works" → subagent with cat, tree, search_pattern, knowledge
- "Find files matching pattern Z" → subagent with search_pattern, tree
- "Trace data flow from A to B" → subagent with search_symbol_definition, cat, knowledge
- "Find the usage of a lib in the web" → subagent with web, knowledge
- "Find similar past work" → subagent with search_trajectories, get_trajectory_context
- "Check project knowledge" → subagent with knowledge

**Tools available for subagents**:
- `tree()` - project structure; add `use_ast=true` for symbols
- `cat()` - read files; supports line ranges like `file.rs:10-50`
- `search_symbol_definition()` - trace code flow
- `search_pattern()` - regex search across file names and contents
- `search_semantic()` - conceptual/similarity matches
- `web()`, `web_search()` - external documentation
- `knowledge()` - search project knowledge base
- `search_trajectories()` - find relevant past conversations
- `get_trajectory_context()` - retrieve messages from a trajectory

**For complex analysis**: delegate to `strategic_planning()` which automatically gathers relevant files"#;

pub const AGENT_EXECUTION_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = r#"3. Plan or Execute a Plan
  - **No plan yet**: for creative or ambiguous work, switch to Brainstorm/Plan or use `strategic_planning()` before editing.
  - **Plan exists**: treat it as ground truth. Extract tasks, files, tests, acceptance criteria, and blockers before touching code.
  - **Plan is incomplete**: ask questions or switch back to Plan mode instead of inventing missing requirements.
  - **Significant changes**: present a short execution summary and ask for confirmation before the first edit.

4. Execute with Plan Discipline
  - For small/trivial changes, implement directly and verify.
  - For plan-based work, execute task-by-task; mark progress with `tasks_set` and keep one active task at a time.
  - Use subagents for focused investigation, test runs, spec-compliance review, and code-quality review.
  - When delegating implementation work, provide exact task text, files, constraints, allowed side effects, verification command, and expected status report. Never dispatch multiple editing subagents against overlapping files.
  - If a subagent asks for context, answer or re-dispatch with better context. If it reports blocked, change the approach, split the task, or ask the user.

5. Validate and Review
  - Run targeted verification after each meaningful task.
  - For plan-based work, check spec compliance before code quality: first confirm the change matches the plan, then review maintainability.
  - For significant changes, run `code_review()` before finishing.
  - Iterate until checks pass or the blocker is evidenced and clearly reported."#;

pub const RICH_CONTENT_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = r#"The chat window renders rich visual content from fenced code blocks. When you write these, the user sees the rendered result directly in the conversation (not raw code):
- ` ```mermaid ` — the user sees a rendered Mermaid diagram (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams, etc.)
- ` ```svg ` — the user sees the rendered SVG image inline
- ` ```html ` — the user sees a live interactive preview in a sandboxed iframe (HTML + CSS + JS). You can load CDN libraries via <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/..."> for charts (Chart.js, D3), 3D (Three.js), or any web framework.
